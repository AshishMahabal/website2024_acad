Here I present a silly little genetic program in perl based on A K Dewdney's 
flibs.
This strange planet is inhabited by flibs, creatures that take bits
from the environment and change their own state depending on their 
present state and the input bit and prdict the next incoming bit.
The bit pattern repeats itself after a fixed length. 
Flibs that correctly predict the environmental bits survive more 
than those who do not. Generations get created by mating and mutations.<BR>
