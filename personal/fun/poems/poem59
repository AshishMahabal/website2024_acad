BY EXAMPLE 
  By
  Henry Matthew Ward 
   
   
  When I got mad and hit my child 
  "For his own good," I reconciled 
  And then, I realized my plight 
  Today, I taught my child to fight. 
  When interrupted by the phone I said, 
  "Tell them I'm not at home." 
  And then I thought, and had to sigh 
  Today I taught my child to lie.
  I told the tax man what I made 
  Forgetting cash that I was paid 
  And then I blushed at this sad feat 
  Today, I taught my child to cheat. 
  I smugly copied a cassette, 
  To keep me free of one more debt. 
  But now the bells of shame must peal 
  Today, I taught my child to steal. 
  Today, I cursed another race. 
  Oh God, protect what I debase, 
  For now, I fear it is too late. 
  Today, I taught my child to hate. 
  By my example, children learn 
  That I must lead in life's sojourn 
  In such a way that they are led 
  By what is done, not what is said. 
  Today, I gave my child his due 
  By Praises for him instead of rue. 
  And now I have begun my guide: 
  Today, I gave my child his pride. 
  I now have reconciled and paid 
  To IRS on all I made. 
  And now I know that this dear youth 
  Today has learned from me of Truth.
  The alms I give are not for show 
  And yet, this child must surely know 
  That charity is worth the price; 
  Today, he saw my sacrifice. 
  I clasp within a warm embrace 
  My neighbor of another race- 
  The great commandment from above. 
  Today, I taught my child to love.
