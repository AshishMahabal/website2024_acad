'Out of Control' 

 Once, high on a hill, there was a song 
 Nothing was wrong, that's when time stood still 
 Now lovers are caught, tied in their dreams 
 Bound in their thoughts, wrapped in the depth of their love 
 
 If I can hold on to you 
 If I can hold on to you 
 
 Somewhere near the end, lovers pretend 
 Fake what they feel, take what they get from love 
 Start missing the drive, staying alive 
 Four out of five, without the feeling of love 
 
 If the sky is fire and hell is blue 
 If all of our dreams won't come true 
 If the sky is fire and hell is blue 
 I'll cover you, I'll cover you 
 
 Sky is fire, hell is blue 
 Sky is fire, hell is blue 
 
 That's why I'm out of control 
 Tear myself down, build myself up, tear myself down again 
 I'm talking to you, trying to get through 
 Don't want to hide, lost in the mirror of love 
 
 If I can hold on to you 
 If I can hold on to you 

	-- Neil Young 

Heard this CSNY song this morning and thought i would submit it. its not
great poetry, but its nice.

Funny thing is, the song is titled 'Out of Control', but the tune and rhythm
are very serene and calm and peaceful; the words also seem very calm and
measured and not very out of control - either in rhythm or in meaning. So
the title doesnt exactly match the rest of it. 

I liked the way falling out of love is described - 'Somewhere near the end,
lovers pretend'. Also the 'Tear myself down, build myself up, tear myself down 
again' part - describes the confusion nicely. 

Basically I liked the song and now I'm trying to give commentary to explain
why I liked it. Can't think of anything more to write.
