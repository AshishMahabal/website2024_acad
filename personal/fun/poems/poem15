 "Seduction" 
 
 Weep not for little Leonie,
 Abducted by a French Marquis!
 Though loss of honour was a wrench,
 Just think how it's improved her French.

	-- Harry Graham

Today's contribution of Ogden Nash's "The Purist" inspired me to check
whether any of Harry Graham's delightfully wicked gems have appeared on the
Minstrels list before.  Harry Graham (1874-1936) was a prolific English poet
and playwright, best known today for two volumes of verse, "Ruthless Rhymes
for Heartless Homes" and "More Ruthless Rhymes."

A brief biography of him appears in the "St. James Guide to Children's
Writers," and is accessible via the Biography Resource Center database.

Today's poem is one of my favorites.
