 "The Puppet"

 The puppet thinks:
 It's not so much 
 what they make me do
 as their hands inside me.

	-- Charles de Lint

This is a beautiful little piece from a Charles De Lint story. I don't have
much to offer in the way of analysis or commentary, as the poem is almost
like a haiku in its clarity. The author provides a beautiful metaphor in the
puppet. Normally a toy, it takes on a sinister undertone here that seems
tied to a vision of humanity. This poem also reminded me greatly of the film
"Being John Malkovich." Basically, I submit it because it sends shivers up
my spine.
