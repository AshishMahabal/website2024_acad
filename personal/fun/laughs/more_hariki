A conversation between a guru(G) and a finishing graduate student(FGS):

G: I see that your talents have gone beyond the mere
physical level. Your skills are now at the point of
spiritual insight. I have several questions. 
What is the highest technique you hope to achieve?

FGS: There is no technique!

G: Very good! What are your thoughts when facing the
referee?

FGS: There is no referee!

G: And why is that?

FGS: Because the word "truth" does not exist!

G: Umm, I'm listening....!

FGS: A good paper is like a play, but played seriously.
A good researcher does not become tensed but ready. 
Thinking and yet not forgiving. 
When the referee hits, I strike back. 
When  struck I smother the referee with my handicap! 
When there is an opportunity I hit the referee square to the 
ground, never feeling sorry for one moment.

G: I am happy with you. But now you must remember that
the referee hides behind the mask of deception and 
prejudice. 
Fight the prejudice and the physics will recover on its own! 
Amen!!

FGS: I understand gurudeva...
