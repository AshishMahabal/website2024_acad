A couple was golfing one day on a very, very exclusive golf course, lined 
with
million dollar houses. On the third tee the husband said, 
"Honey, be very careful when you drive the ball- don't knock out any windows.
It'll cost us a fortune to fix." 

The wife teed up and shanked it right through the window of the biggest house
on the course. The husband cringed and said, "I told you to watch out for the
houses! Alright, let's go up there, apologize, and see how much this is 
going to
cost." 

They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, "Come on in." 

They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and a broken bottle 
lying
on its side in the foyer. A man on the couch said, "Are you the people 
that broke
my window?" 

"Uh, yeah. Sorry about that." the husband replied. 

"No, actually I want to thank you- I'm a genie that was trapped for a 
thousand
years in that bottle. You've released me. I'm allowed to grant three 
wishes-I'll
give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself." 

"OK, great!" the husband said. " I want a million dollars a year for the 
rest of my
life." 

"No problem-it's the least I could do. And you, what do you want?" the genie
said, looking at the wife. 

"I want a house in every country of the world," she said. 
"Consider it done." the genie replied. 

"And what's your wish, genie?", the husband said. 

"Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, I haven't had sex with a 
woman in a
thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife." 
The husband looks at the wife and said, "Well, we did get a lot of money 
and all
those houses, honey. I guess I don't care." 

The genie took the wife upstairs and ravished her for two hours. 

After it was over, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife, and said, 
"How old
is your husband, anyway?" 

"35." she replied. 

"And he still believes in genies- that's amazing."
