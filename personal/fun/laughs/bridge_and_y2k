An Indian politician came to the US to visit his counterpart. When the 
senator invited him home for dinner, the minister was very impressed 
by the lavish mansion, grounds and the costly furnishings. He asked "How 
can you afford all this on a meagre senator's salary?" 

The sentaor smiled knowingly and took him to the window. 
"Can you see the river?" 
"Yes" 
"Can you see the bridge over it?" 
"Of course", said the minister. 
"10 percent", said the senator smugly. 

Some time later, he had occasion to pay a return visit. The Indian 
minister lavished all hospitality on him. When he came to his house, the 
Senator was stunned by the huge palace the minister had built, 
glittering with precious art, hundreds of servants etc etc. 

"How can you possibly afford this, on a salary in Rupees ?', he asked. 
The minister called him to the window. 
"See the river over there?" 
"Sure", cried the senator. 
"Can you see the bridge over it?" 
The senator looked, was confused, peered closely and said - 
"No, I don't see any bridge." 
"100 percent", said the minister 
======================== 
Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, and Bill Gates were invited to have dinner 
with God. 

During dinner, God told them, "I invited you to dinner, because I 
needed three important people to send my message out to all people - 
Tomorrow, I will destroy the Earth!!" 

Yeltsin immediately called together his cabinet and told them, "I 
have two really bad announcements to make. First, God really does exist, 
and second, tomorrow He will destroy the Earth." 

Clinton called an emergency session of Congress and told them, "I 
have good news and bad news. The good new is that God does exist, and 
the bad news is that he will destroy the Earth tomorrow." 

Bill Gates went back to Microsoft headquarters and told his people, 

"I have two fantastic announcements! First, I am one of the three most 
important people on Earth, and second, the Year 2000 Problem has been 
solved!"
