<!-Text-!>If you thought that the previous sutra makes multiplication easy, you aint seen nothin&#39; yet. <BR> <BR>When numbers are of a certain type, different sutras can be used to do the work even more quickly for you. We will see how  <BR> <BR><FONT FACE="Shivaji01,shusha,Shivaji05" size="+1">inaiKlaM navatXcarmaM dXat¡</FONT> <BR> <BR>is used. The literal meaning of the sutra is: <BR>all from nine, last from ten. <BR> <BR>It is useful when at least one of the numbers is close to a power of 10 &#40;our base&#41; and is based on the algebraic identity: <BR>&#40;x-a&#41;&#42;&#40;x-b&#41;=x&#40;&#40;x-a&#41;-b&#41;&#43;ab <BR> <BR>Let us take an example: 8x7 <BR> <BR>Both are single digits, and therefore last digits, so apply &#34;last from 10&#34; i.e. take 10s compliment and obtain 2 and 3 <BR> <BR>08 -2 &#40;-2 because it is 2 less than 10&#41; <BR>x7 -3 <BR>----- <BR> <BR>Now subtract 3 from 8 or 2 from 7 &#40;cross&#41; to get 5 <BR>as the 10s place &#40;x-a-b or x-b-a&#41;. To get the units place, just multiply -2 and -3 &#40;ab=6&#41; and you have the answer viz. 56. <BR> <BR>Another example: <BR>95x95 <BR> <BR>095 -5 <BR>x95 -5 <BR>------ <BR>090/25 = 9025 <BR>&#40;90 was obtained by subtracting 5 from 95, and 5x5=25&#41; <BR> <BR>98x89 <BR> <BR>098 -2 <BR>x89 -11 <BR>------- <BR>087/22 = 8722 <BR> <BR>Thus when both numbers are close to and under 10, 100, 1000 etc., this sutra is very useful and much faster than the previous one <BR> <BR>989x992 <BR> <BR>0989 -11 <BR>x992 -8 <BR>-------- <BR>0981/088 = 981088 <BR> <BR>Notice that we now wrote 11x8 as 088 &#40;i.e. used three positions for it because our base this time was 1000, the third power of 10&#41;. You have to use a similar trick when the RHS overflows: <BR> <BR>88x88 <BR> <BR>088 -12 <BR>x88 -12 <BR>------- <BR>076/&#40;1&#41;44 = 7744 <BR> <BR>Now our base was 100, so of the 144 we got, we use only 44 and carry 1 over to the LHS. <BR> <BR>Also note that you do not really have to memorize 12x12=144 because <BR>&#40;x&#43;a&#41;&#42;&#40;x&#43;b&#41;=x&#40;x&#43;a&#43;b&#41;&#43;ab comes into play i.e. <BR> <BR>012 &#43;2 <BR>x12 &#43;2 <BR>------ <BR>014/4 = 144 <BR> <BR>Similarly <BR> <BR>17x17 <BR> <BR>017 &#43;7 <BR>x17 &#43;7 <BR>------ <BR>024/&#40;4&#41;9 = 289 &#40;4 was carried since our base was 10&#41; <BR> <BR>103x105 <BR> <BR>0103 &#43;3 <BR>x105 &#43;5 <BR>-------- <BR>0108/15 = 10815 <BR> <BR>109x111 <BR> <BR>0109 &#43;9 <BR>x111 &#43;11 <BR>-------- <BR>0120/99 = 12099 <BR> <BR>Try things out yourself and yo will notice the magic in it. <BR> <BR>Lastly &#40;x-a&#41;&#42;&#40;x&#43;b&#41;=x&#40;x-a&#43;b&#41;-ab will work too. <BR> <BR>103x98 <BR> <BR> <BR>103 &#43;3 <BR>x98 -2 <BR>------- <BR>101/-6 = 10100-6 = 10094 <BR> <BR>17x9 <BR> <BR>17 &#43;7 <BR>x9 -1 <BR>----- <BR>16/-7 = 153 <BR> <BR>1011x888 <BR> <BR>1011 &#43;11 <BR>x988 -12 &#40;notice that first 2 digits were  <BR>--------- removed from 9 and last from 10&#41; <BR>999/-132 = 998868 <BR> <BR>&#40;remember that we can get the LHS part in two ways: <BR>1011-12=999=988&#43;11 i.e. you have the choice of whatwever you feel is easier&#41;. <BR> <BR>Do practice witha few examples: <BR> <BR>999x999 <BR>1011x1013 <BR>997x1004 <BR>99x99 <BR>103x103 <BR> <BR>Use the technoque twice for <BR>1017x1017 <BR>1017x988 <BR>10103x10107 <BR>9899x9888<!-/Text-!><P> </FONT>
