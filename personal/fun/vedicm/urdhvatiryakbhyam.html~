To an extent it will also help along with Geometry. Reciprocals and ratios pitch in handily. It is simple, but like anything, you need to try it and do some practice. <BR> <BR>We will be using base10 almost throughout. Another important concept is that of compliment. We will extensively use the concept of 9s and 10s compliment.  <BR>What is the 9s compliment of 7? 2 <BR>What is the 10s compliment of 7? 3 <BR> <BR>For some of the tricks/calculations, we will use 10s compliments of digits larger than 5 and will show them with a dash &#40;to indicate compliment&#41; above them &#40;I will think of a way to do that&#41;.<!-/Text-!><P> </FONT> 
 <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="000000"><!-Text-!>The most important formula aka <FONT FACE="Shivaji01,shusha,Shivaji05" size="+1">sau~</FONT> is <BR><FONT FACE="Shivaji01,shusha,Shivaji05" size="+1">}Qva-itya-gByaama</FONT> which means vertical and crosswise. It is excellent for carrying out multiplications. It is based on the following algebraic identity: <BR>&#40;ax&#43;b&#41;&#42;&#40;cx&#43;d&#41;=acx&#42;x&#43;&#40;bc&#43;ad&#41;&#42;x&#43;bd with x=10 for the decimal system that we use. Let us try the following: <BR> <BR> <BR>037 &#40;a=3, b=7&#41; <BR>x68 &#40;c=6, d=8&#41; <BR>--- <BR> <BR> <BR>By conventional method it will be: <BR> <BR>0037 <BR>x068 <BR> ---- <BR>0296 <BR>222 <BR>----- <BR>2516 <BR> <BR>&#40;I wrote 068 etc. for formatting. How can one do uneven indenting?&#41; <BR>Let us see how it is with vertical and cross-wise <BR>&#40;1&#41; First the vertical units place: 8&#42;7=56 <BR> Put 6 down and carry 5 over <BR> ---6 <BR>&#40;2&#41; Add the carried over 5 to the cross multiplication of ad and bc i.e. 8x3&#43;6x7&#43;5=71 <BR> Put 1 down and carry 7 over <BR> --16 <BR>&#40;3&#41; Finally do the vertical for the 10s place. <BR>Add carried over 7 to a&#42;c i.e. 3&#42;6&#43;7=25 <BR> Put that down <BR> 2516 <BR> <BR>We have arrived at the solution in a &#34;single&#34; step! <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; Let us do the discussions in a separate BB &#42;&#42;&#42;<!-/Text-!><P> </FONT>
