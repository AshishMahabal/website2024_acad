<p>The sutra means vertical and crosswise.
It is excellent for carrying out multiplications. It is based
on the following algebraic identity: <br>
(ax+b)*(cx+d)=acx*x+(bc+ad)*x+bd
Using x=10 makes it immediately applicable to the decimal system that we
use.
<P>Let us try the following: <br>
<br>
<br>
037 (a=3, b=7) <br>
x68 (c=6, d=8) <br>
--- <br>
<br>
<br>
By conventional method it will be: <br>
<br>
   37 <br>
x68 <br>
---- <br>
0296 <br>
222 <br>
----- <br>
2516 <br>
<br>
Let us see how it is with vertical and cross-wise <br>
(1) First the vertical units place: 8*7=56 <br>
Put 6 down and carry 5 over ---6 <br>
(2) Add the carried over 5 to the cross multiplication of ad and bc i.e.
8x3+6x7+5=71 <br>
Put 1 down and carry 7 over --16 <br>
(3) Finally do the vertical for the 10s place. <br>
Add carried over 7 to a*c i.e. 3*6+7=25 <br>
Put that down 2516 <br>
<br>
We have arrived at the solution in a "single" step! <br>
<br>

<p>A longer example of the same: <br>
000345 <br>
x00789 <br>
------ <br>
003105 <br>
02760 <br>
2415 <br>
------ <br>
272205 (doing it conventionally) <br>
<br>
By our newly learnt method: <br>
9*5=45 (write 5 carry 4) <br>
9*4+8*5+4=80 (write 0 carry 8) <br>
9*3+8*4+7*5+8=102 (write 2 carry 10) <br>
8*3+7*4+10=62 (write 2 carry 6) <br>
7*3+6=27 (write it all since that is the last part) <br>
One Step Answer: 272205 <br>
(ax*x+b*x+c)*(dx*x+e*x+f)= <br>
adx^4+(ae+bd)x^3+(af+be+cd)x^2+(bf+ce)x+cf <br>
<br>
And this can of course be extended to any number of digits trivially. <br>
