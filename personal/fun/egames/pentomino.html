Just like a domino which is constructed from 2 squares juxtaposed
 along the sides, a pentomino is constructed from 5 such squares,
 each having atleast one of its sides along that of another. While 
 there is a unique domino, pentominos come in 12 different flavors.
 And that is what makes them interesting. I have reproduced 
 <A HREF="images/pentos.jpg"</A><b>here</B></A>
 the 
 12 forms. But before peeping in, try to construct them yourself.
 To give you an idea, here are the tetrominos on which the game
 tetris is based.<P>

 The challenge is to arrange the 12 different forms together so that
 they fit in a rectangle of 10 x 6. If you get frustrated, just peep
 into the famous <A HREF="images/clarke.jpg" <B>
 illustration</B></A> provided by Clarke in the Imperial Earth.<P>

 Believe me, there are thousands of such unique combinations possible (2339 to
 be precise). The hidden
 challenge is to write a program which will generate all these solutions.
 I have a recursive program that uses brute force to do that. The c program fits
 into 45 lines (besides the datafile) but it is
 obviously too slow. A lot of fast programs are available on the net.
 Some of these use the truncated tree approach. Can YOU do it? 
 A graphical interface would be best.<P>

 Before I leave the topic of ...minos, can you fill the chessboard with
 linear triminos? Obviously not! 1 square will be left over. Can you 
 prove that there are only four specific squares on the board which can
 be left vacant (one at a time ofcourse) by covering the rest of the
 board by 21 linear triminos? What squares are these?<P>

 <A HREF="pentosolutions.html">Few pentomino solutions</A> obtained by 
 my brute force C program.<P>

 If you do write the program, do let me know. I am willing to pass on
 the code that I have scripted to people interested. Free ofcourse!!<P>
<A HREF="pento.html">Java</A> version of a program 
that gives you all the possible solutions if you wait long enough.<P>
 Have fun.<P>
 Recently I came across another pentomino page. 
 <A HREF="http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~gbuehler/introd.html">Guenter Buehler</A>
 has a fast DOS program that gives you all the solutions to the problem.
 He also has some other intersting stuff on art and logic.
