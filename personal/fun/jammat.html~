Played 2D kitie with Jay - a game of my/our inventing (to be called "jammat"
henceforth). He found it fun.
Its a little better than just kitie. Std kitie (I am not sure of the spelling 
- could not find a link) involves dealing 9 cards and making 3 triplets:
triples, or sequences, or pairs etc. One with better triplets wins. In the 2D 
version we require the cards to be arranged in a 3x3 matrix thus
generating 8 triplets (3H, 3V and 2D). It is trikier to arrange them
thus. Again, the one with better triplets wins. in 3D one will have
39 triplets making it intractable (almost). It will start resembling
set or 4-in-a-row in some fashion.

Deal 9 cards each to all the players. If you wish to have equal probabilities
or if there are more than 5 players, use multiple decks. Each player now
arranges the 9 cards in a 3x3 matrix (to get 8 3-ples: 3 vertical, 3 horizontal
and 2 diagonal).

The player tries to maximize the following
types of 3-ples in that order:
<OL>
<LI>A triplet: 3 kings, or 3 4's etc. 3 Aces are the highest
<LI>A sequence: 6-7-8 or 3-4-5 or A-2-3 or A-K-Q. A-K-Q is highest and 3-2-1 lowest
(though some games treat the later to be higher). Also, the 3 cards could be in
any order i.e. 2-3-A is the same as A-2-3. A "pure" sequence (i.e. a sequence all
of whose cards are from the same suite) is higher than an ordinary sequence. In fact,
any pure sequence is higher than every non-pure sequence.
<LI>A color: 3 cards of the same suite e.g. 3, 5 and J of Hearts. If tw players
have colors in the same round, the higher cards (A counting as highest followed
by K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2) determine the winner. All suites have the same value
i.e. there is no suite-hierarchy.
<LI>A pair: 2 cards with the same face value (and clearly of different suites unless
multiple decks are mixed) e.g. H3, C3 and C7. A-pair is highest followed by K-pair
etc. In case of tied pairs, the third card decides the winner.
<LI>highest card: when none of the above combinations is possible, the higher cards
determine the winner.
</OL>
Once the 9 cards are arranged to maximize the above combinations, players
compare their 8 3-ples with those of others. Highest 3-ples are compared to the highest
of the others. One who wins more 3-ples is the overall winner.
