The <A HREF="https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/">Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)</A>, an initiative of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), working with tens of institutions on accelerating the translation biomarker research for clinical applications and to detect cancers as early as possible.

I work with the Data Science team at JPL to do machine learning for early detection of cancer, and to help build datasets for that purpose. I also do methodology transfer applying techniques from astronomy to medical data to understand the patterns therein. The domain experts are important and can not be (and should not be) removed from the loop, but abstracting the data allows many methods to be applied with minimal nudging.

Our Virtual Reality work on this (and MCL) was recently featured in SigGraph (2019, Los Angeles).
