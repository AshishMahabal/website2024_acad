<A HREF="http://alerce.science/">Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE)</A> is an effort for the classification of astronomical alerts. A majority of the members are from Chile, and as the ALeRCE team gets ready for LSST, they are using the ZTF alert stream for training models and algorithms.

As part of CRTS and ZTF I have contributed some labeled data, and am loosely involved in the machine learning and classification effort of the group through collaborative meetings and through teaching at the La Serena Schools on Data Science (partly funded by NSF).
