The <A HREF="https://www.lsst.org/">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</A> is a project that will begin observing in Oct. 2022 from a 8.4m telescope in Chile. Over 10 years it will obtain 1000 observations in 6 filters generating 15 TB data nightly.

I was a co-chair of the <A HREF="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Transient and Variable Source (TVS) Science Collaboration</A> for a few years, and I am part of the Informatics and Statistics SC. The alert brokers for LSST are currently training on the alerts produced by <A HREF="/project/ztf">ZTF</A>.
