The <A HREF="https://catalina.lpl.arizona.edu/">Catalina Sky Survey (CSS)</A> NEO project uses three dedicated telescopes to cover thirty three thousand square degrees (now two in Arizona). The <A HREF="http://crts.caltech.edu/">Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS)</A> utilized the CSS data to search for rare and interesting transients and variables. Currently the transients are not actively screened. 

I worked on classification of transients as well as building some initial infrastructure.
