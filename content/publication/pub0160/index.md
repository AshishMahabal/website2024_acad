abstract: "We present a preliminary analysis of comet P/2019 LM$_4$ (Palomar) as observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey in 2019 and 2020. We find that the discovery of the comet in 2019 and the recovery in 2020 is largely attributed to two separate outbursts that are $gtrsim2$ and $gtrsim3.9$ mag in strength. The outbursts occurred around the end of April to early May of 2019 as well as between 2020 May 8.31 and 9.52 UTC, respectively."
