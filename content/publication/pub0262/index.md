abstract: "Policy Brief on  arcsecLatest Developments and Opportunities in Sky Survey arcsec, distilled from the corresponding panel that was part of the discussions during S20 Policy Webinar on Astroinformatics for Sustainable Development held on 6-7 July 2023.   Sky surveys have been a crucial tool in advancing our understanding of the Universe. The last few decades have seen an explosion in the number and scope of sky surveys, both ground-based and space-based. This growth has led to a wealth of data that has enabled us to make significant advances in many areas of astronomy, and help understand the physics of the universe. They have helped us discover new astronomical objects, the origin of the elements, dark matter and dark energy, the accelerated expansion of the universe, and gravitational waves. They have helped us study the distribution of neutral and ionized matter in the Universe and test our theories about the origin and evolution of galaxies, stars, and planets. We explore recent advances and potential avenues in sky surveys, and examine how these developments may impact the field of international astronomical research.   The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023). A summary based on the seven panels can be found here: arxiv:2401.04623."
