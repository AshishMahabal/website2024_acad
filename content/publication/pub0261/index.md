Astronomy brings together advanced scientific research, state-of-the-art technology, and educational initiatives, all while captivating and stimulating people of all ages. By doing so, it possesses the potential to serve as a powerful catalyst for sustainable global development and the resolution of global societal issues. It attracts a diverse range of scientists and experts from various fields, fostering collaboration and innovation. By leveraging their resources, influence, and diplomatic initiatives, S20 academies can foster an enabling environment for international collaborations in astronomy, facilitate knowledge exchange, and drive scientific advancements that benefit humanity. This policy brief explores the opportunities and challenges presented by regional and global collaborations in astronomy.   The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023). A summary based on the seven panels can be found here: arxiv:2401.04623."
