abstract: "Policy Brief on  arcsecWorkforce Development in Astronomy and Astroinformatics arcsec, distilled from the corresponding panel that was part of the discussions during S20 Policy Webinar on Astroinformatics for Sustainable Development held on 6-7 July 2023.   The discipline of astronomy and astroinformatics is dynamically evolving thereby creating a compelling opportunity to foster a more inclusive, diverse, and proficient workforce. This is crucial for addressing multifaceted challenges that emerge as we progress and harness the potential therein. To realize this goal, it's imperative to cultivate strategies that promote inclusive practices in STEM education, encourage participation from historically excluded groups, provide training and mentorship, as well as provide active champions, especially for students and early career professionals from (historically) excluded groups. We provide an overview of the current status, resources available, and possible steps especially keeping in mind large international projects.   The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023). A summary based on the seven panels can be found here: arxiv:2401.04623."
