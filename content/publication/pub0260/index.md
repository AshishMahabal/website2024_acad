abstract: "Policy Brief on  arcsecLarge Projects in Astronomy: An Indian Endeavour arcsec, distilled from the corresponding panel that was part of the discussions during S20 Policy Webinar on Astroinformatics for Sustainable Development held on 6-7 July 2023.   Cutting-edge astronomy initiatives often entail substantial investment and require a high level of expertise. Even the most technologically advanced nations recognize the value of establishing international partnerships to secure both financial resources and talent for these ambitious endeavours as they hold immense promise for catalysing transformative scientific discoveries, driving technological innovation, provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists and engineers, and expanding our understanding of the cosmos that surrounds us. Crucially, large-scale multilateral collaborations serve as powerful agents for promoting unity and peace among the global population. Participants from various nations share a vested interest in the success of these projects and the wealth of knowledge they yield, fostering a sense of common purpose and shared goals. By utilizing astroinformatics capabilities, these initiatives are not merely enhancing our comprehension of the universe but are also actively contributing to the attainment of sustainable development objectives. In this discussion, we delve into the challenges faced, and prospects for substantial astronomical undertakings. Additionally, we present recommendations aimed at guaranteeing their effectiveness and optimizing their influence on both scientific advancement and society.   The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023). A summary based on the seven panels can be found here: arxiv:2401.04623."
