abstract: "We present X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations of the nearby ($approx78$ Mpc) tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv during its first 430 days of evolution. AT2021ehb occurs in the nucleus of a galaxy hosting a $approx 10^{7},M_odot$ black hole ($M_{rm BH}$ inferred from host galaxy scaling relations). High-cadence Swift and NICER monitoring reveals a delayed X-ray brightening. The spectrum first undergoes a gradual ${rm soft }rightarrow{rm hard}$ transition and then suddenly turns soft again within 3 days at $delta tapprox 272$ days during which the X-ray flux drops by a factor of ten. In the joint NICER+NuSTAR observation ($delta t =264$ days, harder state), we observe a prominent non-thermal component up to 30 keV and an extremely broad emission line in the iron K band. The bolometric luminosity of AT2021ehb reaches a maximum of $6.0^{+10.4}_{-3.8}% L_{rm Edd}$ when the X-ray spectrum is the hardest. During the dramatic X-ray evolution, no radio emission is detected, the UV/optical luminosity stays relatively constant, and the optical spectra are featureless. We propose the following interpretations: (i) the ${rm soft }rightarrow{rm hard}$ transition may be caused by the gradual formation of a magnetically dominated corona; (ii) hard X-ray photons escape from the system along solid angles with low scattering optical depth ($sim,$a few) whereas the UV/optical emission is likely generated by reprocessing materials with much larger column density -- the system is highly aspherical; (iii) the abrupt X-ray flux drop may be triggered by the thermal-viscous instability in the inner accretion flow leading to a much thinner disk."
