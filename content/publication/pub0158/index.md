abstract: "We present visible and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of interstellar object 2I/Borisov taken from 2019 September 10 to 2019 November 29 using the GROWTH, the APO ARC 3.5 m and the NASA/IRTF 3.0 m combined with post and pre-discovery observations of 2I obtained by ZTF from 2019 March 17 to 2019 May 5. Comparison with imaging of distant Solar System comets shows an object very similar to mildly active Solar System comets with an out-gassing rate of $sim$10$^{27}$ mol/sec. The photometry, taken in filters spanning the visible and NIR range shows a gradual brightening trend of $sim0.03$ mags/day since 2019 September 10 UTC for a reddish object becoming neutral in the NIR. The lightcurve from recent and pre-discovery data reveals a brightness trend suggesting the recent onset of significant H$_2$O sublimation with the comet being active with super volatiles such as CO at heliocentric distances $>$6 au consistent with its extended morphology. Using the advanced capability to significantly reduce the scattered light from the coma enabled by high-resolution NIR images from Keck adaptive optics taken on 2019 October 04, we estimate a diameter of 2I's nucleus of $lesssim$1.4 km. We use the size estimates of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov to roughly estimate the slope of the ISO size-distribution resulting in a slope of $sim$3.4$pm$1.2, similar to Solar System comets and bodies produced from collisional equilibrium."
