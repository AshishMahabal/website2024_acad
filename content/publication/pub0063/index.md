abstract: "The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) currently covers 33,000 deg^2 of the sky in search of transient astrophysical events, with time baselines ranging from 10 minutes to ~7 years. Data provided by the Catalina Sky Survey provides an unequaled baseline against which >4,000 unique optical transient events have been discovered and openly published in real-time. Here we highlight some of the discoveries of CRTS."
