abstract: "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy released when supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close. TDEs provide a new window to study accretion onto SMBHs; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best studied jetted TDE to date is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in gamma-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical discovery of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z=1.19325) whose unique lightcurve transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-rays, sub-millimeter, and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron  arcsecafterglow arcsec, likely launched by a SMBH with spin $a gtrsim 0.3$. Using 4 years of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data, we calculate a rate of $0.02 ^{+ 0.04 }_{- 0.01 }$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for on-axis jetted TDEs based on the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that about 1% of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs."
