Bird stuff
<P>

## US birds

Here is a <A HREF="usbirds">list of birds</A> that I have seen
and identified (mostly in Pasadena and nearby parts of California). 
There are a few more which I think I know but am not certain
as yet. 
<BR>
A <A HREF="allusbirds">complete list of US birds</A> is also available.
<BR>
You can see the <A HREF="birdpics">pictures of these birds</A> too.
