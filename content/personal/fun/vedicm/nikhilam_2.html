That was oversimplification. It can be used in many more circumstances. <BR> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier new"> <BR>Consider 51x53 <BR> <BR>051 -49 <BR>x53 -47 <BR>-------- <BR> <BR>The 49*47 that we will have to do is as bad as 51*53. So instead we use not 100 as base, but 100/2=50. Then <BR> <BR>051 +1 <BR>x53 +3 
<BR>------- <BR>054/03 <BR> <BR>Now comes an additional step: because we used 100/2=50 as base, divide the LHS by two too: <BR>54/2=27 and the answer is 2703. <BR> <BR>Alternately, do the same using base=10*5=50 <BR> <BR>051 +1 <BR>x53 +3 <BR>------ <BR>054/3 (note we have a single digit in RHS rather   <BR> than 03 since the basic base was 10 rather  <BR> 100) <BR>Now the last step: 54*5=270 and the answer is <BR>2703. <BR> <BR>Another example: <BR>249x244 (base 1000/4=250) <BR> <BR>0249 -1 <BR>x244 -6 <BR>-------- <BR>0243/006 <BR>---- 
<BR>  4 <BR> <BR>60/756 (3/4 that remained after 243/4 becomes 750) <BR> <BR>78x77 <BR> <BR>078 -2 <BR>x77 -3 <BR>------ <BR>75*8 6=6006 <BR> <BR>198*203 <BR> <BR>0198 -2 <BR>x203 +3 <BR>------- <BR>201*2 -06 = 402 -06 = 40194 <BR> <BR>Sometimes of course the urdhvatiryakbhyam method is much quicker. <BR> <BR>0198 <BR>x203 <BR>----- <BR>8x3=(2)4 <BR>9x3+2=(2)9  <BR>3x1+2x8+2=(2)1 <BR>9x2+2=(2)0 <BR>2x1+2=4 <BR>Answer: 40194</FONT> <BR>
