"The Ballad of the Imam and the Shah"
(An Old Persian Legend)

to C. E. H.

 It started with a stabbing at a well
 Below the minarets of Isfahan.
 The widow took her son to see them kill
 The officer who'd murdered her old man.
 The child looked up and saw the hangman's work --
 The man who'd killed his father swinging high,
 The mother said: 'My child, now be at peace.
 The wolf has had the fruits of all his crime.'
 
  From felony to felony to crime
  From robbery to robbery to loss
  From calumny to calumny to spite
  From rivalry to rivalry to zeal
 
 All this was many centuries ago --
 The kind of thing that couldn't happen now --
 When Persia was the empire of the Shah
 And many were the furrows on his brow.
 The peacock the symbol of his throne
 And many were the jewels and its eyes
 And many were the prisons in the land
 And many were the torturers and spies.
 
  From tyranny to tyranny to war
  From dynasty to dynasty to hate
  From villainy to villainy to death
  From policy to policy to grave
 
 The child grew up a clever sort of chap
 And he became a mullah, like his dad --
 Spent many years in exile and disgrace
 Because he told the world the Shah was bad.
 'Believe in God,' he said, 'believe in me.
 Believe me when I tell you who I am.
 Now chop the arm of wickedness away.
 Hear what I say, I am the great Imam.'
 
  From heresy to heresy to fire
  From clerisy to clerisy to fear
  From litany to litany to sword
  From fallacy to fallacy to wrong
 
 And so the Shah was forced to flee abroad.
 The Imam was the ruler in his place.
 He started killing everyone he could
 To make up for the years of his discgrace.
 And when there were no enemies at home
 He sent his men to Babylon to fight.
 And when he'd lost an army in that way
 He knew what God was telling him was right.
 
  From poverty to poverty to wrath
  From agony to agony to doubt
  From malady to malady to shame
  From misery to misery to fight
 
 He sent the little children out to war.
 They went out with his portrait in their hands.
 The desert and the marshes filled with blood.
 The mothers heard the news in Isfahan.
 Now Babylon is buried under dirt.
 Persepolis is peeping through the sand.
 The child who saw his father's killer killed
 Has slaughtered half the children in the land.
 
 From felony
 to robbery
 to calumny
 to rivalry
 to tyranny
 to dynasty
 to villainy
 to policy
 to heresy
 to clerisy
 to litany
 to fallacy
 to poverty
 to agony
 to malady
 to misery --
 
 The song is yours. Arrange it as you will.
 Remember where each word fits in the line
 And every combination will be true
 And every permutation will be fine:
 
  From policy to felony to fear
  From litany to heresy to fire
  From villainy to tyranny to war
  From tyranny to dynasty to shame
 
  From poverty to malady to grave
  From malady to agony to spite
  From agony to misery to hate
  From misery to policy to fight!
 
              -- James Fenton

[Note: if you can't get this by e-mail, the "From...to...to..." 
sections, as well as the first part of the title, "The Ballad of the 
Imam and the Shah", should be set in italics.]

I heard this poem on BBC Radio 4, read by the poet. 'Read' is an 
insufficient word, though, for the passionate, angry, bitter rendition 
he gave. I've been trying to get them to put up the audio file on 
bbc.co.uk so it can be heard more widely, but I was impressed upon 
finding it and reading it to see how strongly it encourages the style of 
reading Fenton gave. It was read fast, and staccato, with heavy emphasis 
on the line endings. The first and second normal verses start out a bit 
slower, less emphasized and broken, but the emphasis and staccato feel 
increases with the speed from the first to the second to the third, 
while the refrain is all but spat out full speed from the beginning.

Now that I've got a book of his poems (Out of Danger, Noonday Press 
1994), I find he frequently uses repetitions and permutations with 
similar effect. In some ways the strange and bleak refrain running 
through this poem could start to sound like Dr. Suess, but for the 
actual vocabulary employed.

This poem could in one respect be summarized by the phrase 'plus Ã§a 
change, plus c'est la mÃªme chose'. The will to end the oppression of the 
Shah brings about another oppression no less horrible. It is about 
repetition, the historical perpetuation of violence and oppression, and 
repetition and circularity occurs on several levels in the poem, and is 
driven home by the final part, encouraging you to rearrange the terms, 
causes and effects as you will, and come up with truth in each and every 
permutation. But also the whole poem, which keeps up the pretense of 
speaking of times long past, in the atemporal terms of a legend, reminds 
us that this is the way things were in the beginning, are now, and ever 
shall be.

The structure of almost every line reinforces the
crumbling-and-tumbledown-and-crash rhythm with which Fenton read it, 
which makes it all the more bleak and grim. The curious, surprising, 
direct repetition in the beginning of each line of what I'm calling the 
refrain - 'From x to x to y' - drives home the cyclic nature of the 
errors and horrors, and yet sees, or foresees, the final collapse into 
the worst, final consequence of its monosyllabic end.

RCB
 
[Martin adds:

 In later correspondence, discussing the oddly scanning line "The peacock
 the symbol of his throne", which I thought perhaps missing a word in the
 transcription, Reed confirmed that the line was correct, and added:
 
   The poem, as perhaps I should have mentioned, was set to music, along
   with several others in the book, mostly about horrible, bleak wars
   and tyrannies of recent history, in a 'pocket musical' called 'Out of
   the East' (which is also the title of an incredible poem, similarly
   depressing and yet drivingly energetic, about the war in Cambodia and
   the making of the Khmer Rouge). It was performed in 1990 as a song.
   But when I heard it on the BBC it was just a reading by the author,
   however energetically performed. In the musical version, that
   hypometric line could sound natural - I'd love to hear it.

"Dreadful" 
 
 Someone ate the baby.
 It's rather sad to say.
 Someone ate the baby
 So she won't be out to play. 
 We'll never hear her whiney cry
 Or have to feel if she is dry.
 We'll never hear her asking "Why?"
 Someone ate the baby.
 
 Someone ate the baby.
 It's absolutely clear
 Someone ate the baby
 'Cause the baby isn't here. 
 We'll give away her toys and clothes.
 We'll never have to wipe her nose.
 Dad says, "That's the way it goes."
 Someone ate the baby.
 
 Someone ate the baby.
 What a frightful thing to eat!
 Someone ate the baby
 Though she wasn't very sweet. 
 It was a heartless thing to do.
 The policemen haven't got a clue.
 I simply can't imagine who
 Would go and (burp) eat the baby. 
 	
	-- Shel Silverstein

All I could think when I read the title of 'the lost baby poem' was
'Dreadful' and since it seems to be very stream of consciousness/related by
a slip of memory on the Minstrels these days I thought I'd pass along this.
I went on to read 'the lost baby poem' and enjoyed it but in the interest of
keeping things light...  My mom use to be very disgusted with this poem.  It
didn't help that it was so easy to commit to memory and recite at
inopportune times.  I still get a kick out of it and thought you might too.
My baby sister doesn't think it's as funny as I do but then she never was
very sweet.  This poem is from 'Where the Sidewalk Ends'.

'Sonnet'
 
 All we need is fourteen lines, well, thirteen now,
 and after this one just a dozen
 to launch a little ship on love's storm-tossed seas,
 then only ten more left like rows of beans.
 How easily it goes unless you get Elizabethan
 and insist the iambic bongos must be played
 and rhymes positioned at the ends of lines,
 one for every station of the cross.
 But hang on here wile we make the turn
 into the final six where all will be resolved,
 where longing and heartache will find an end,
 where Laura will tell Petrarch to put down his pen,
 take off those crazy medieval tights,
 blow out the lights, and come at last to bed.

	-- Billy Collins
 
Billy Collins is easy to love and easier to understand, but for all that, I
don't think he could be classified under "Light Verse". He almost always
manages to get serious without seeming to. But then, the things he takes
seriously are often the things which we are conditioned NOT to take seriously,
but which we secretly do care about. His realm of expertise is the marginalia
(see poem #1130) of the mind - history, literature, pets, food, and how all
these get mixed up with our daydreams and memories and form bits of our life.
He's quite like a kindly, dreamy professor going about it, and this blends
beautifully with his dry, educated humour ("Laura will tell Petrarch to put
down his pen.").

I found a book of his poems which keep me awake half the night, but I picked
this one over a lot of others because I read it with the delight of recognition
- having given an English exam recently - and the warm, fuzzy, not at all
cynical final image of the muse telling her devotee call it a day is, for me,
one of Billy Collins' finest achievements.

'Hamlet'

 Said Hamlet to Ophelia,
 'I'll do a sketch of thee,
 What kind of pencil shall I use,
 2B or not 2B?'

       --Spike Milligan

On reading the recently published Milligan's poem "The ABC", went searching on
the net for more. Whereupon I stumbled across this cute little one. The point
here is, texting is the order of the day and teachers are more worried about
youngsters using these short text forms.

Add to this, the furore created over an essay written by a teen which goes like
"My smmr hols wr CWOT. B4, we used 2go2 NY 2C my bro, his GF & thr 3 :- kids
FTF. ILNY, it's a gr8 plc" (Translation: "My summer holidays were a complete
waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his
girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's
a great place.")

And then read this article[1] recently in "The Hindu". To quote from it, "To be
or not to be, that is the question" became "2b r not 2b that's?" or even more
mathematically as: "2b/-2b=?" (Though what Milligan means in the verse is the
pencil type, it very well fits the SMS text of today)

Thats all the much reason why I'm sending the above verse 2 u. oops, to you ;-)

thanks,
arvind

'A Psychological Tip'

 Whenever you're called on to make up your mind,
 and you're hampered by not having any,
 the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find,
 is simply by spinning a penny.

 No - not so that chance shall decide the affair
 while you're passively standing there moping;
 but the moment the penny is up in the air,
 you suddenly know what you're hoping
 
 	-- Piet Hein

I had the hardest time deciding which of the Piet Hein poems to send in to
this list :). They're all absolutely WONDERFUL. He calls his poems "Grooks"
and apparently he wrote em in several languages!  I had read this poem years
ago and went back looking for it when a friend of mine responded to my last
guest poem ("The instruction manual") complaining that I never send him a
poem that can make its point without being 300 words long.

Biography:
Piet Hein (1905-1996) was a Danish poet and scientist with wide ranging
interests. Millions of his countrymen knew him as Kumbel, the pen name he
used for his poetry. He was a genius with many different sides. In addition
to discovering the Soma cube, he created a new geometrical form, the
"super-ellipse", which is something in between the rectangle and the
ellipse. The form also came in a 3D version and was then called "the super
egg" or "the super-ellipsoide".  As an artist and constructor, Piet Hein in
the 50's and 60's gave form to beautiful pieces of furniture, and he
contributed to make "Scandinavian design" become an international
conception. Internationally he always tried building a bridge between the
"hard" technical and natural sciences and the "soft" humanistic subjects.

Here's the link to the website I copied the biography from and it also has
his other poems. Enjoy!!!

'The Blind Men and the Elephant'

 It was six men of Indostan
 To learning much inclined,
 Who went to see the Elephant
 (Though all of them were blind),
 That each by observation
 Might satisfy his mind
 
 The First approached the Elephant,
 And happening to fall
 Against his broad and sturdy side,
 At once began to bawl:
 God bless me! but the Elephant
 Is very like a wall!
 
 The Second, feeling of the tusk,
 Cried, Ho! what have we here
 So very round and smooth and sharp?
 To me tis mighty clear
 This wonder of an Elephant
 Is very like a spear!
 
 The Third approached the animal,
 And happening to take
 The squirming trunk within his hands,
 Thus boldly up and spake:
 I see, quoth he, the Elephant
 Is very like a snake!
 
 The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
 And felt about the knee.
 What most this wondrous beast is like
 Is mighty plain, quoth he;
 'Tis clear enough the Elephant
 Is very like a tree!
 
 The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
 Said: Even the blindest man
 Can tell what this resembles most;
 Deny the fact who can
 This marvel of an Elephant
 Is very like a fan!?
 
 The Sixth no sooner had begun
 About the beast to grope,
 Than, seizing on the swinging tail
 That fell within his scope,
 I see, quoth he, the Elephant
 Is very like a rope!
 
 And so these men of Indostan
 Disputed loud and long,
 Each in his own opinion
 Exceeding stiff and strong,
 Though each was partly in the right,
 And all were in the wrong!
 
 Moral:
 
 So oft in theologic wars,
 The disputants, I ween,
 Rail on in utter ignorance
 Of what each other mean,
 And prate about an Elephant
 Not one of them has seen!
 
 	-- John Godfrey Saxe
 
 
Just one of those masterpieces which everyone has heard and no one really
thinks of submitting! Anyway, all the versions I've heard before did not
include the last "Moral" passage. 'Extended Edition' !!!!

The moral is so apt in modern times, with religious disputes setting the
planet on fire. Having been the 'justifiable' (I'm Hindu by birth, and
don't really care about religion) target of righteous right-winged
evangelists in the US who argue about how they know exactly what God
wanted to make of the world, I could not agree more with the poet.

This is supposed to be based on a fable from India. I would be curious to
know more about the exact origins though.

My favorite line: the one for the fifth guy, who starts with "Even the
blindest man..." So poignant in the context of religious disputes!

[Martin adds]

Raj is right - I can't believe we've not run this one yet. A true classic,
and one beloved of generations of schoolteachers (and schoolkids - it's a
very accessible poem for younger kids, rhythmic, visual, funny and
memorable). I'd be hard pressed to call this a great poem (it's *too*
simplistic, IMO, and the rhymes and rhythms too singsong), but it has, I
think, achieved a deserved immortality.

'Children'

 And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of
 Children."
 
 And he said:
 
 Your children are not your children.
 
 They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
 
 They come through you but not from you,
 
 And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.
 
 You may give them your love but not your thoughts.
 
 For they have their own thoughts.
 
 You may house their bodies but not their souls,
 
 For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit,
 not even in your dreams.
 
 You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
 
 For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
 
 You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
 
 The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you
 with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
 
 Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
 
 For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that
 is stable.
 
 	-- Kahlil Gibran

Throughout 'The Prophet', Kahlil Gibran manages to bring together great
insight into how life works (or should, at any rate) and truly beautiful
language. And he makes the two seem mutually indispensible.  Which is why he
appeals to me intellectually as well as aesthetically. He is a master of
analogies and his texts have many that are apt and natural - that of the
archer in this poem is close to perfection.

>From a more simplistic viewpoint, he places the "Leave me alone/Let go of
me" phenomenon that most 'children' experience at some point in a much
wider context. I say this because in recent months the topic of how one
should "bring one's parents up" <g> has come up repeatedly with some of my
friends. Well, here is how. (The minor problem that remains is conveying
it to the parents... <g>)

radhika.

Google spews out vast amounts of pages on Gibran. To name two:

http://leb.net/gibran has a detailed biography of Gibran as well as a lot
of his writings in full. (Including The Prophet.) They spell the first
name Khalil.

http://impact.civil.columbia.edu/~fawaz/g-gallery.html has many of
Gibran's illustrations that appear in The Prophet.

"The Touch Of The Master's Hand"

'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer 
       Thought it scarcely worth his while 
To waste much time on the old violin, 
       But held it up with a smile.
"What am I bidden, good folks," he cried, 
     "Who'll start the bidding for me?"
"A dollar, a dollar. Then two! Only two? 
      Two dollars, and who'll make it three?" 

"Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice; 
      Going for three..." But no, 
>From the room, far back, a grey-haired man 
      Came forward and picked up the bow; 
Then wiping the dust from the old violin, 
      And tightening the loosened strings, 
He played a melody pure and sweet, 
      As a caroling angel sings.

The music ceased, and the auctioneer, 
      With a voice that was quiet and low, 
Said: "What am I bid for the old violin?" 
      And he held it up with the bow. 
"A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two? 
      Two thousand! And who'll make it three? 
Three thousand, once; three thousand, twice, 
     And going and gone," said he. 

The people cheered, but some of them cried, 
     "We do not quite understand. 
What changed its worth?" Swift came the reply: 
     "The touch of the Master's hand."
And many a man with life out of tune, 
      And battered and scarred with sin, 
Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd 
      Much like the old violin. 

A "mess of pottage," a glass of wine, 
     A game -- and he travels on. 
He is "going" once, and "going" twice, 
    He's "going" and almost "gone." 
But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd 
     Never can quite understand 
The worth of a soul and the change that is wrought
     By the touch of the Master's hand.

	-- Myra Brooks Welch

Note: "mess of pottage" is a Biblical reference - see 
  http://www.m-w.com/wftw/02apr/041702.htm for example.

Now that you are running some "spiritual" poems, here is an old favourite. I
don't know if you could get away with this kind of poem
any more these days, but come on, admit it, it does bring a little 
lump to the throat. I wonder if I should be ashamed to admit that I 
like it.

I have no idea who the author is, though I presume she is American.

Frank O'Shea 

[Martin adds]

What I find sad is not just that this sort of poetry is falling out 
of vogue, but that people really *are*, as Frank half-jokingly 
suggests, ashamed to admit that they like it. Somehow, 'taste' and 
'sophistication' seem to have become equated with a kind of sneering 
cynicism whose popularity, I think, is attributable to the fact that 
it is far easier to *assume* than true taste is. Personally, I 
enjoyed today's poem (and similar ones like Adelaide Proctor's "The 
Lost Chord" [Poem #520], but with the definite consciousness that 
this was, somehow, a less-than-respectable opinion.

'Evening'

 Day abandons it
 Night disowns it
 
 a poet picks it up
 threads it
 into a poem;
 but sometimes
 it is barren,
 so impotent
 it gives nothing,
 not even to the poet. 

    -- Gulzar

While surfing through the net, i came across this gem of a poem by Gulzar,
and, wonder of wonders, it's in English. Being a weekend, me and a friend were
exploring various emotionally charged Hindi songs and hit upon the idea of
surfing for Gulzar's creations, one of the geniuses of our time. The poem is
about evening and well.. just go through it!   

[Martin adds]

Indeed a beautiful poem - it captures the fleeting, elusive nature of evening
as well as anything I've seen. And it stands in refreshing contrast to all
those poems that rhapsodise about twilit evenings (a time of day and quality of
light that have always struck me as more depressing than otherwise. Give me
dawn any day).

'Polterguest, My Polterguest'

 I've put Miss Hopper upon the train,
 And I hope to do so never again,
 For must I do so, I shouldn't wonder
 If, instead of upon it, I put her under.
 
 Never has host encountered a visitor
 Less desirable, less exquisiter,
 Or experienced such a tangy zest 
 In beholding the back of a parting guest.
 
 Hoitful-toitful Hecate Hopper
 Haunted our house and haunted it proper,
 Hecate Hopper left the property
 Irredeemably Hecate Hopperty.
 
 The morning paper was her monopoly
 She read it first, and Hecate Hopperly,
 Handing on to the old subscriber
 A wad of Dorothy Dix and fiber.
 
 Shall we coin a phrase for "to unco-operate"?
 How about trying "to Hecate Hopperate"?
 On the maid's days off she found it fun
 To breakfast in bed at quarter to one.
 
 Not only was Hecate on a diet,
 She insisted that all the family try it,
 And all one week end we gobbled like pigs
 On rutabagas and salted figs.
 
 She clogged the pipes and she blew the fuses,
 She broke the rocker that Grandma uses,
 And she ran amok in the medicine chest,
 Hecate Hopper, the Polterguest.
 
 Hecate Hopper, the Polterguest
 Left stuff to be posted or expressed,
 And absconded, her suavity undiminished,
 With a mystery story I hadn't finished.
 
 If I pushed Miss Hopper under the train
 I'd probably have to do it again,
 For the time that I pushed her off the boat
 I regretfully found Miss Hopper could float.
 
 	-- Ogden Nash

I think there's something about Nash that's irresistible. He just 
sweeps you up and away with him.

This one is my absolute favourite. You find yourself in sympathy 
with his - even if only in jest - homicidal tendencies. Everybody 
has met one of these irritating people. Heck, it could even be 
ourselves... Grin.

atheos.

>From The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash, with an introduction by Louis 
Untermeyer (I personally think Untermeyer gushes too much, but I thought I 
should type everything out because it has some rather nice lines 
interspersed between the longwinded prose.):

 "There seem to be at least three Ogden Nashes. There are, for 
 example: 1. the experimental craftsman 2. the social critic 3. the 
 skylarking humourist. Sometimes Nash keeps these three selves 
 fairly well segregated. But, more often than not, he lets down the 
 bars and allows 1. the innovator, 3. the philosopher, and 3. the 
 funny fellow to kick up their heels in happy unison. This volume 
 is chiefly given over to the best of those tripartite romps.
 
 It was Nash in the role of experimental craftsman who first made 
 readers aware that something new had happened to light verse in 
 America. Accustomed to smoothly paired rhymes and neatly measured 
 stanzas, readers were suddenly stopped by the impact of lines 
 like:
 
 I sit in an office at 244 Madison Avenue
 And say to myself you have a responsible job, havenue?
 
 Cajoled by talk of babies, even parents were startled to find:
 
 A bit of talcum
 Is always walcum.
 
 The reader of Nash learned his lessons in a new school; he learned 
 of too much affection which:
 
 .. leads to breaches of promise
 If you go lavishing it around on red hot momise.
 
 He pondered the theatrical reflection that:
 
 In the Vanities
 No one wears panities.
 
 He learned to decipher the weird but comforting axiom that:
 
 A girl who is bespectacled,
 She may not get her necktacled;
 But safety pins and bassinets
 Await the girl who fassinets.
 
 Here and elsewhere Nash invents lines that run blithely on without 
 benefit of metre and rhymes so madcap as to be irresponsible. 
 Instead of pleasing the reader with the customary niceties, Nash 
 assaults him with a series of breathless outrages. One or two 
 fanatical source-hunters claim to have found the origin of Nash's 
 eccentric lines in W.S. Gilbert's "Lost Mr. Blake". But an 
 unprejudiced comparison will show that the two styles have little 
 in common and that, whereas Gilbert made the experiment just once, 
 Nash uses it so freely and so efficiently that he has put his 
 trademark upon it.
 
 So with the rhymes. Nash is the master of surprising words that 
 nearly but do-not-quite match, words which rhyme reluctantly, 
 words which never before had any relation with each other and 
 which will never be on rhyming terms again.
 Here are those apparently improvised monologues in which the 
 distortions are more lively - and more quotable - than any 
 prepared accuracy.
 
 What would you do if you were up a dark alley with Caesar Borgia
 And he was coming torgia...
 
 But the slightly lunatic manner is deceptive. Disguised as a 
 buffoon who cannot resist a parody and a pun, there is the social 
 critic. Here again Nash has a fresh set of surprises up his ample 
 sleeve... Even without his unique bag of technical tricks, Nash 
 creates the deftest light verse being written today. The longer 
 and more elaborately contrived poems are topical and timely; but 
 there is something timeless in the nimble gallantry of "To a Lady 
 Passing Time Better Left Unpassed". the whimsical appeal of 
 "Complaint to Four Angels", the submerged but not too supressed 
 anger of "To a Small Boy Standing on My Shoes While I Am Wearing 
 Them", the affable sentiment of "An Introduction To Dogs". and the 
 merry malice in what is perhaps the most philosophic and certainly 
 the funniest poem in the collection, "The Seven Spritual Ages of 
 Mrs. Marmaduke Moore".
 
 Nash the rhyming clown may win us first, but it is Nash the 
 laughing philosopher who holds us longest. Only Nash could have 
 combined the tones of banter and burlesque to tell us:
 
 Our daily diet grows odder and odder-
 It's a wise child that knows its fodder.
 
 Finally there emerges from this collection a portrait of Nash 
 himself, the whole person not quite concealed by the poet. We are 
 made aware of his intimate dislikes or (since most of them begin 
 with a "p") his prejudices; they include politicians and people's 
 names and parsley ("parsley is gharsley") and poems by Edgar A. 
 Guest and professors and parties next door. We see him leaping 
 about without effort from childlike fancy to mature irony; a crazy 
 storyteller one moment, a satirist the next, a wry clown and a 
 chuckling critic. It is then that we recognize how rounded the man 
 really is, how much more than the haphazard rhymer he reveals. His 
 is an inspired method which has just the right measure of madness 
 in it, a recklessness that is never without reason. In other and 
 flatter words, Nash is our greatest combiner of common sense and 
 uncommon nonsense, the undisputed American heir of Edward Lear, 
 Lewis Carroll and W. S. Gilbert.

'Electronically Yours'

    Baud: the rate of speed at which information is
    sent between two computer devices,
    for example, modems.

 From 1200 plus, our baud
 declined. At under 300, a blank.
 EXIT. Or so I thought. But bits
 of you <alluring syllables, the
 burnt-in codes of half-unearned
 caresses "lost" when power died>
 were saved, it seems, to memory's
 soft disk. I found a file called
 HIDDEN FILES. Delete <Y/N>?

	-- Gerald Jonas

Today I ran across this poem, which I had cut out of a
magazine years ago (I don't remember which magazine,
possibly The New Yorker)).

I liked the way the poet used modern (at least at that date)
computer terminology and images to describe the
fragmentary memories that remain after a relationship
has died.

I Googled for Gerald Jonas, and found references to a
few science fiction stories and one other poem (Imaginary
Numbers in a Real Garden), but no reference to this particular
one.

http://isfdb.tamu.edu/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Gerald_Jonas

I also found reference to a poetry reading in 2001 which
gave this mini-bio:

Gerald Jonas is a regular reviewer of science fiction for the New York 
Times, the author of six nonfiction books and a screenwriter of nationally
televised documentaries. He worked at The New Yorker from 1963-1993.

[Martin adds]

While this is an interesting poem, it hasn't dated too well - the
combination of the modern theme and the fast-obsolete and
already-forgotten jargon sets up a dissonance that detracts from the
imagery of the poem - particularly jarring was the reference to "soft
disks".

It still fascinates me, though, to see the way in which poets (and alongside
them, writers of science fiction, particularly cyberpunk) have evoked poetry
from the rising tide of new phenomena, idioms and metaphors that accompany
the information revolution. This week, I'll be running a series of such
poems - as usual, feel free to chime in on the theme.

'Out of Control' 

 Once, high on a hill, there was a song 
 Nothing was wrong, that's when time stood still 
 Now lovers are caught, tied in their dreams 
 Bound in their thoughts, wrapped in the depth of their love 
 
 If I can hold on to you 
 If I can hold on to you 
 
 Somewhere near the end, lovers pretend 
 Fake what they feel, take what they get from love 
 Start missing the drive, staying alive 
 Four out of five, without the feeling of love 
 
 If the sky is fire and hell is blue 
 If all of our dreams won't come true 
 If the sky is fire and hell is blue 
 I'll cover you, I'll cover you 
 
 Sky is fire, hell is blue 
 Sky is fire, hell is blue 
 
 That's why I'm out of control 
 Tear myself down, build myself up, tear myself down again 
 I'm talking to you, trying to get through 
 Don't want to hide, lost in the mirror of love 
 
 If I can hold on to you 
 If I can hold on to you 

	-- Neil Young 

Heard this CSNY song this morning and thought i would submit it. its not
great poetry, but its nice.

Funny thing is, the song is titled 'Out of Control', but the tune and rhythm
are very serene and calm and peaceful; the words also seem very calm and
measured and not very out of control - either in rhythm or in meaning. So
the title doesnt exactly match the rest of it. 

I liked the way falling out of love is described - 'Somewhere near the end,
lovers pretend'. Also the 'Tear myself down, build myself up, tear myself down 
again' part - describes the confusion nicely. 

Basically I liked the song and now I'm trying to give commentary to explain
why I liked it. Can't think of anything more to write.

'John Keats'

 John Keats
 John Keats
 John
 Please put your scarf on.

	-- J. D. Salinger
          (From "Seymour An Introduction")

You know it's a good poem when you reach the quiet end and find something's
taken your breath away and left a knot in your throat instead. Couldn't Not
send this in after the Cullen's poem [Poem #1497]. His lines read wrenching,
read like they've been ripped from the dramatic depths of a poet's passion-
and pain.  This poem by contrast is more like a child tugging at your coat
sleeve.  Filled with persistence and a very vulnerable power. This is a poem
written by Seymour aged 8 and we only learn of its existence through Buddy,
his brother (both of them members of the Glass family created by J. D.
Salinger).

Seymour is an unusual child who grows up to be an unusual man and this
particular poem is just a throwaway detail in a book full of throwaway
details that for some reason you don't throw away, but stop at suddenly-
because they are saying so much that you almost didn't hear and they make
you wonder what else in your world might be saying crucial things that you
are drowning out in a profusion of detail. But what got me then and what
gets me now is the stark simplicity of this poem's understated pleading and
its tender tardiness, and sure I know that it's Salinger and not Seymour who
wrote it, but the thought of the thought of this poem in the head of an 8
year old child...

And suddenly I am sad inside, really sad for the first time for a boy-man
named John, John Keats who loved beauty and who wrote its truth, and who
died of tuberculosis when he was 25.

'Law Like Love'

 Law, say the gardeners, is the sun, 
 Law is the one 
 All gardeners obey 
 To-morrow, yesterday, to-day.
 
 Law is the wisdom of the old, 
 The impotent grandfathers feebly scold; 
 The grandchildren put out a treble tongue, 
 Law is the senses of the young.
 
 Law, says the priest with a priestly look, 
 Expounding to an unpriestly people, 
 Law is the words in my priestly book, 
 Law is my pulpit and my steeple.
 
 Law, says the judge as he looks down his nose, 
 Speaking clearly and most severely, 
 Law is as I've told you before, 
 Law is as you know I suppose, 
 Law is but let me explain it once more, 
 Law is The Law.
 
 Yet law-abiding scholars write:
 Law is neither wrong nor right,
 Law is only crimes
 Punished by places and by times, 
 Law is the clothes men wear 
 Anytime, anywhere, 
 Law is Good morning and Good night.
 
 Others say, Law is our Fate; 
 Others say, Law is our State; 
 Others say, others say 
 Law is no more, 
 Law has gone away.
 
 And always the loud angry crowd, 
 Very angry and very loud, 
 Law is We, 
 And always the soft idiot softly Me.
 
 If we, dear, know we know no more
 Than they about the Law,
 If I no more than you
 Know what we should and should not do
 Except that all agree
 Gladly or miserably
 That the Law is
 And that all know this
 If therefore thinking it absurd
 To identify Law with some other word,
 Unlike so many men
 I cannot say Law is again,
 
 No more than they can we suppress 
 The universal wish to guess 
 Or slip out of our own position 
 Into an unconcerned condition. 
 Although I can at least confine 
 Your vanity and mine 
 To stating timidly 
 A timid similarity, 
 We shall boast anyway: 
 Like love I say.
 
 Like love we don't know where or why, 
 Like love we can't compel or fly, 
 Like love we often weep, 
 Like love we seldom keep.
 
 	-- W. H. Auden

In response to Michelle's call for poems about lawyers and the law, here's
one of my favourite Auden poems. Aside from the usual Auden brilliance (the
tone so nonchalantly conversational, the seemingly endless ability to carry
on with a single metaphor) this poem has always been special to me for three
reasons. First, that unlike many Auden poems this one comes to its "timid
similarity" right at the very end, so that having chuckled through the poem
once you are almost compelled to go back to the beginning and read it
through again, this time replacing Law with Love and realising how truly
brilliant the comparison is. 

Second, that it's a poem that cries to be read aloud - even reading it in
one's head every stanza has it's own 'voice' creating an incredible
impression of movement as one jumps breathlessly from one person's
view--point to another's. 

And finally, for a gem of a last line - one that both makes you laugh and
makes you want to cry with a terrible longing for our lost loves.  In a poem
that is otherwise fairly cheerful it introduces a note of honest grief, that
lifts the poem above the merely clever.

 "The Purist"

 I give you now Professor Twist,
 A conscientious scientist,
 Trustees exclaimed, "He never bungles!"
 And sent him off to distant jungles.
 Camped on a tropic riverside,
 One day he missed his loving bride.
 She had, the guide informed him later,
 Been eaten by an alligator.
 Professor Twist could not but smile.
 "You mean," he said, "a crocodile."

	-- Ogden Nash 

I can see that there are quite a few Ogden Nashes in your collection, but
this particular one is a personal favourite. Unlike his longer rambling
poems, this one captures so much, so humourously and so accurately in so
little. It is a wonder no one thought of suggesting this one for your
anthology.

I can picture an old naturalist-academician in khakis through muddy swamps
in Central America, thoroughly devoted to newts and alligators and other
amphibians, with very little time for his loving bride. I think his almost
mathematical preciseness, even at a time of such utter loss, is not so much
an effect of sang-froid as it is of a habitual inclination to set the other
guy right - I have heard of that being called 'academic arrogance'. It's
pure reflex action for him - and the realisation that old habits die hard
bring out his smile. I should imagine that to be a very wry smile indeed!

The other cool thing is that with the first two lines, the poem is
introduced as an introduction. 'I give you now...' clearly indicates an
appearance on a dias/podium of some sort. What is so darkly funny is that
whoever is introducing Prof. Twist with these words had to chose this
anecdote to prove the professor's conscientiousness.

Today's contribution of Ogden Nash's "The Purist" inspired me to check
whether any of Harry Graham's delightfully wicked gems have appeared on the
Minstrels list before.  Harry Graham (1874-1936) was a prolific English poet
and playwright, best known today for two volumes of verse, "Ruthless Rhymes
for Heartless Homes" and "More Ruthless Rhymes."

A brief biography of him appears in the "St. James Guide to Children's

Today's poem is one of my favorites.

ENDPOEM submitted by Frank O'Shea <foshea@ozemail.com.au>, who suggests
running a a series under the heading 'The Poet Cranky':

 "The Curse" 

 Lord, confound that surly sister,
 Blight her brow with blotch and blister,
 Cramp her gullet, lungs and liver
 In her guts a galling give her.
 Let her live to earn her dinners
 In Mountjoy with seedy sinners.
 Lord, this judgement quickly bring
 And I'm your servant, J. M. Synge.

	-- J. M. Synge

 Note: Mountjoy is a Dublin prison.

The poem was in answer to one of the critics of his Playboy of the Western
World. In reply, Synge attacked the critic's sister! It is likely that the
poem was never intended for publication, but Yeats got his hands on it and
sent it to Lady Gregory and she never lost anything. So it was kept for
posterity as a beautiful piece of invective, only partly tongue-in-cheek.

Isn't it a pity that we seem to have lost the art of good invective? Now,
all people do is use the well-abused F and C words from the Anglo-Saxon or
wherever.

You already have one of the very best of the cranky poet genre in James
Stephens' "translation" of Daithi O'Bruadair's poem "The Glass of Beer"
(#185). I put the inverted commas because it is a translation in the sense
that Fitzgerald's is a translation of the Rubaiyat, owing more to Stephens
than to the originator.

This only sort of fits "the poet cranky" theme.  While I'm sure this was

ENDPOEM submitted by E. Brooke <brooksie137@yahoo.com> :

 "Sonnet -- To Science"
 
 Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
   Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
 Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
   Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
 How should he love thee? or deem thee wise?
   Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
 To seek for treasure in the jeweled skies,
   Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
 Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
   And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
 To seek a shelter in some happier star?
   Has thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
 The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
 The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?  

	-- Edgar Allan Poe
	(1829, 1845)
 
   Under the traditional Shakespearean sonnet structure, Poe expresses
nontraditional accusations for science.  Like mostly all Poe's poems, it is
a psychological study of a speaker suffering the most human of flaws.  In
this case, it is spoken through the tunnel vision of a passionate man
mourning the slaughter of mythology, fantasy, art by its alleged archenemy,
Science.  He questions the desertion of the imagination by the objective
force of science.  He is inclined to avoid logic in his argument, although
the classic sonnet structure implies his own attempt to rationalize his own
thoughts.  Perhaps the structure contrasted with such unreigned feelings
further insinuates humanity's paradoxical need for organization in every
field of thought, including the self-proclaimed resisters of logic.  
   You cannot fully trust this speaker.  He is borderline obsessive, which
blinds him to truth through moderation.  He constrains his thinking to one
side of the spectrum where he is unable to see the interconnection between
science and art.  He prophesizes ultimate death approaching poetry through
science's "peering eyes."  He is scared -- if not for himself -- then for
art in general, for the obliteration of his ability to dream.  Herein lies
the speaker's hypocrisy.  Although he speaks wildly about his disrespect for
science because it disallows for fantasy and dreaming, he adheres to the
logic applied to poetry as demonstrated by the conventional sonnet
structure.  
   This is a beautiful poem, rich with layers to every aspect.  The concept
of remaining open-minded to every field of thought is one that is relevant
to every human being since ignorance breeds ignorance.  To modern readers,
especially now during the age of skepticism, this poem rings true since the
current emphasis and faith has been placed on science to supply truth.  The
speaker is microcosmic of most of humanity, for he believes there is a gap
between science and art.  
   Nothing could be further from Truth.
   Poetry and art are not in opposition to science in its perception of
reality.  Rather, poetry uncovers another level of reality that science
cannot, and vice versa.  While the path of scientific fact is one way to
discover truth, so is the path of fantasy.  They are as interconnected and
interdependent as land and ocean.  
   We should all consider our own biases.

 "John Muir on Mt. Ritter"

 After scanning its face again and again,
 I began to scale it, picking my holds
 With intense caution. About half-way
 To the top, I was suddenly brought to
 A dead stop, with arms outspread
 Clinging close to the face of the rock
 Unable to move hand or foot
 Either up or down. My doom
 Appeared fixed. I MUST fall.
 There would be a moment of
 Bewilderment, and then,
 A lifeless rumble down the cliff
 To the glacier below.
 My mind seemed to fill with a
 Stifling smoke. This terrible eclipse
 Lasted only a moment, when life blazed
 Forth again with preternatural clearness.
 I seemed suddenly to become possessed
 Of a new sense. My trembling muscles
 Became firm again, every rift and flaw in
 The rock was seen as through a microscope,
 My limbs moved with a positiveness and precision
 With which I seemed to have
 Nothing at all to do.

	-- Gary Snyder

I recently picked up a wonderful book titled 'The High Sierra of
California'. The book contains woodcut prints of the Sierra Nevada by Tom
Killion in the manner of the Japanese masters Hokusai and Hiroshige. The
beauty of the prints is further brought out by notes, commentaries and poems
by Gary Snyder. The poem really brought out for me the fine line between
control and diaster that a mountain climber deals with, along with the waves
of panic he has to stave off to get to the  top. That it is about John
Muir's first ascent of Mt Ritter is of added significance.

Gary Snyder's biography: 
	
Snyder was born in San Francisco, and brought up in Oregon and Washington
State. He received his BA in anthropology at Reed College, Portland, in
1951. His subsequent career has been a remarkable combination of the
academic and the contemplative, spiritual study and physical labour. Between
working as a logger, a trail-crew member, and a seaman on a Pacific tanker,
he studied Oriental languages at Berkeley (1953-6), was associated with Beat
writers such as Ginsberg and Kerouac, lived in Japan (1956-64), later
studied Buddhism there, and won numerous literary prizes, including a
Guggenheim fellowship (1968) and the Pulitzer Prize (1975). He now teaches
literature and 'wilderness thought' at the University of California at
Davis.

ENDPOEM submitted by Aseem Kaul, <mithwarg@yahoo.com>: 

 "Ars Poetica"
    
 I have always aspired to a more spacious form
 that would be free from the claims of poetry or prose
 and would let us understand each other without exposing
 the author or reader to sublime agonies.

 In the very essence of poetry there is something indecent:
 a thing is brought forth which we didn't know we had in us,
 so we blink our eyes, as if a tiger had sprung out
 and stood in the light, lashing his tail.

 That's why poetry is rightly said to be dictated by a daimonion,
 though its an exaggeration to maintain that he must be an angel.
 It's hard to guess where that pride of poets comes from,
 when so often they're put to shame by the disclosure of their frailty.

 What reasonable man would like to be a city of demons,
 who behave as if they were at home, speak in many tongues,
 and who, not satisfied with stealing his lips or hand,
 work at changing his destiny for their convenience?

 It's true that what is morbid is highly valued today,
 and so you may think that I am only joking
 or that I've devised just one more means
 of praising Art with the help of irony.

 There was a time when only wise books were read
 helping us to bear our pain and misery.
 This, after all, is not quite the same
 as leafing through a thousand works fresh from psychiatric clinics.

 And yet the world is different from what it seems to be
 and we are other than how we see ourselves in our ravings.
 People therefore preserve silent integrity
thus earning the respect of their relatives and neighbors.

 The purpose of poetry is to remind us
 how difficult it is to remain just one person,
 for our house is open, there are no keys in the doors,
 and invisible guests come in and out at will.

 What I'm saying here is not, I agree, poetry,
 as poems should be written rarely and reluctantly,
 under unbearable duress and only with the hope
 that good spirits, not evil ones, choose us for their instrument. 

	-- Czeslaw Milosz 
 
It's been little over a month now since Milosz died and I've finally managed
to find the courage to send in a poem to mark his passing. I do this not
because I feel I have something special to say about Milosz (I admit to
having discovered him only about a year ago) but because as a long-time
devotee of Minstrels I feel it would be a shame if so great a poetic voice
passed away from among us and we said nothing. All his life Milosz found the
words to make loss quiet and exact - exiled by silence, he found a way to
fight it without screaming back. Now that he's dead, we owe it to him not to
let the silence win. 

This poem is a good demonstration of just why Milosz, was, IMHO, so
important to the poetry of his century. It was a century that Milosz himself
described as a time when "We were permitted to shriek in the tongues of
dwarfs and demons / But pure and generous words were forbidden / Under so
stiff a penalty that whoever dared to pronounce one / Considered himself a
lost man" (Milosz - A Task) - too much of the literary legacy of the century
lies with Plath and Ginsberg, with Auden and Eliot, with Langston Hughes and
Bishop and Berryman, with Neruda and Paz. This is not to say, of course,
that these poets do not deserve their stature (far from it - their influence
is clearly well deserved) or that they are the only ones from the last
hundred years who "matter" - only that Milosz represents another and no less
authentic strain of the poetic measure. As he put it himself: "in me there
is no wizardry of words. I speak to you with silence, like a cloud or a
tree." 

Milosz's voice is the voice of a twilight between the silence and the cry,
at once gentle and threatened and uncertain. Milosz speaks from the heart,
but his poems are not to be shouted or declaimed, they are to be read
softly, as among a circle of intimates. He is not a flame - he is a lamp,
his light low yet illuminating. 

Of course, Milosz is not alone here - much of Brodsky resonates with the
same voice and at least some of Walcott. What makes Milosz special, I think
(and I can't explain this) is that his voice is more humble because wiser,
less bitter because more forgiving, more apt to find, if not joy, than at
least peace. Irony is not a major theme for Milosz - on the contrary he
specialises in making moral judgements straight to his reader's face (what
other poet in the last fifty years would say "There was a time when only
wise books were read"). Many people would argue that Milosz is less
important than I make him out to be here (though fifty years of incredible
poetry and a Nobel prize are pretty hard to argue with) and Milosz would be
the first to agree with them.

As I said earlier, this poem is a stunning summary of what Milosz's poems
are about. As we think about his work, I think there are few better ways to
remember him than as the poet who wrote "reluctantly / under unbearable
duress and only with the hope / that good spirits, not evil ones, choose us
for their instrument". It's a test that few poets today could pass. 

Aseem.

 "Wodwo"

 What am I? Nosing here, turning leaves over
 Following a faint stain on the air to the river's edge
 I enter water. Who am I to split
 The glassy grain of water looking upward I see the bed
 Of the river above me upside down very clear
 What am I doing here in mid-air? Why do I find
 this frog so interesting as I inspect its most secret
 interior and make it my own? Do these weeds
 know me and name me to each other have they
 seen me before do I fit in their world? I seem
 separate from the ground and not rooted but dropped
 out of nothing casually I've no threads
 fastening me to anything I can go anywhere
 I seem to have been given the freedom
 of this place what am I then? And picking
 bits of bark off this rotten stump gives me
 no pleasure and it's no use so why do I do it
 me and doing that have coincided very queerly
 But what shall I be called am I the first
 have I an owner what shape am I what
 shape am I am I huge if I go
 to the end on this way past these trees and past these trees
 till I get tired that's touching one wall of me
 for the moment if I sit still how everything
 stops to watch me I suppose I am the exact centre
 but there's all this what is it roots
 roots roots roots and here's the water
 again very queer but I'll go on looking

	-- Ted Hughes

Favourite poems are an odd thing. They're not necessarily the best in the
world and almost certainly not the worst. They just creep up and stick
there. I can't really say why Wodwo is my favourite poem but since I first
read it (sitting in Hamilton Library, drying off from the rain, staying in
the Main Section rather than going to study upstairs in the Reference
Section) it has stuck with me.

At first it confused me. "What's Wodwo? Is it a thing? What kind of creature
is it? Is this a poem about Hughes in the forest? Is it an animal in the
forest?" It's a poem of confusion. But with that confusion there was also an
exhilaration at the language, the lack of punctuation, at questions like
"What am I doing here in mid-air? Why do I find this frog so interesting as
I inspect its most secret / interior and make it my own? Do these weeds know
me ... do I fit in their world?" The sheer breathlessnesss of it all hit me
most.

The poem is one big long question, summed up in the first three words. To
the little lost student I was at the time it came to to be the most
important thing in the world. And of course it wasn't then and it isn't now.
It's not Hughes' best poem, and it's not his worst. But it is my favourite.

Oh, and what *is* a wodwo? I wrote an article about this poem some time ago
and you can get the answer there if you want:

 "The Puppet"

 The puppet thinks:
 It's not so much 
 what they make me do
 as their hands inside me.

	-- Charles de Lint

This is a beautiful little piece from a Charles De Lint story. I don't have
much to offer in the way of analysis or commentary, as the poem is almost
like a haiku in its clarity. The author provides a beautiful metaphor in the
puppet. Normally a toy, it takes on a sinister undertone here that seems
tied to a vision of humanity. This poem also reminded me greatly of the film
"Being John Malkovich." Basically, I submit it because it sends shivers up
my spine.

 "Health Fanatic"
 
 Around the block, against the clock:
 tick tock, tick tock, tick tock;
 running out of breath, running out of socks;
 rubber on the road; flippety flop;
 non-skid agility; chop chop,
 no time to hang about!
 Work out, health fanatic, work out.

 The crack of dawn, lifting weights;
 a tell-tale heart reverberates;
 high in polyunsaturates,
 low in polysaturates;
 a Duke of Edinburgh's award awaits.
 It's a man's life;
 he's a health fanatic; so was his wife.

 A one-man war against decay.
 Enjoys himself the hard way;
 allows himself a Mars a day.
 "How old am I? What do I weigh?
 Punch me there! Does it hurt? No way!"
 Running on the spot, don't get too hot;
 he's a health fanatic, that's why not.

 Peanut power; stay ahead,
 running through the traffic jam taking in the lead.
 Hyperactivity keeps him out of bed.
 Deep down he'd like to kick it in the head.
 They'll regret it when they're dead:
 there's more to life than fun;
 he's a health fanatic; he's got to run.
 
 Beans, greens and tangerines
 and low cholesterol margarines;
 his limbs are loose, his teeth are clean;
 he's a high octane fresh-air fiend.
 You've got to admit he's keen.
 What can you do but be impressed;
 he's a health fanatic. Give it a rest!

 Shadow-boxing; punch the wall;
 One-a-side football;
 "What's the score?" "One all."
 Could have been a copper; too small.
 Could have been a jockey; too tall.
 Knees up, knees up! Head the ball!
 Nervous energy makes him tick;
 he's a health fanatic. He makes you sick!

	-- John Cooper Clarke
 
The poem's by the Mancunian punk poÃ¨te maudit and has aged very well since
it was penned back in the godforsaken days of Thatcherism. The Dr. Seuss duh
simplicity of some lines set against tripping (as in 'tripping up') metrical
asymmetries (his limbs are loose, his teeth are clean; / he's a high octane
fresh-air fiend. / You've got to admit he's keen.) deliciously evoke
post-modern man stumbling, choking and ultimately croaking through life and
missing the point. This memento mori of our times has me, as I hope it has
you, in stitches! Get it?

Ian.

 "Both Sides Now"

 Rows and flows of angel's hair
 And icecream castles in the air
 And feathered canyons everywhere
 I've looked at clouds that way

 But now they only block the sun
 They rain and they snow on everyone
 So many things I would have done
 But clouds got in my way.

 I've looked at clouds from both sides now
 From up and down, but still somehow
 It's cloud illusions I recall
 I really don't know clouds at all. 

 Moon and Junes and Ferris wheels
 That dizzy dancing way you feel
 As every fairy tale comes real
 I've looked at love that way.

 But now it's just another show
 You leave them laughing when you go
 And if you care, don't let them know
 Don't give yourself away. 

 I've looked at love from both sides now
 From give and take, but still somehow
 It's love's illusions I recall
 I really don't know love at all.

 Tears and fears and feeling proud
 To say "I love you" right out loud
 Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
 I've looked at life that way

 But now old friends are acting strange
 They shake their heads, they say I've changed
 Well something's lost, but something's gained
 In living every day.

 I've looked at life from both sides now
 From win and lose, but still somehow
 It's life's illusions I recall
 I really don't know life at all.

	-- Joni Mitchell

Every time someone I know claims that song lyrics aren't really poetry, I
have the urge to sit them down and make them listen to a Joni Mitchell album
to prove to them how wrong they are. Any Joni Mitchell album. 

But of all the songs in all her albums this is the one I would pick if I
really had to make a case for it. 'Both sides, now' has everything -- a
superbly executed rhyme pattern (don't miss the internal rhymes in the
first, fourth and seventh stanzas that pick up the tempo of the song so
effectively), a repeating structure that brings out the deeper allegories,
some incredibly vivid phrases (what better description of a cloud bank than
"feathered canyons everywhere"),  a gorgeous refrain (to really know how
gorgeous, listen to the song and feel the breath catch in your throat as the
pause before "at all" stretches forever and ever) and an emotional range
that goes from the almost joking (Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels) to the
achingly lonesome ("if you care, don't let them know"). 

But most of all, this is a song that even read aloud has a voice all its
own. It's the voice of a generation that grew up too quickly, the voice of
cynicism, the voice of tiredness. But it is also the voice of hope - of the
spirit's struggle to reclaim lost wonder, of an acceptance of one's own
limitations that is both humility and joy. It is at once the voice of our
defeat and the voice of our renewal. 

So if you really don't know Joni Mitchell's music at all (except for a few
allusions on Minstrels you might recall) - do yourself a favour and go out
and buy this album* and listen to Both Sides. Now. 

Aseem.
 
*There are actually two albums - there's Clouds (1970) and Both Sides, Now
(2000) - the versions of the song on both are pretty different and make for
an interesting contrast. (and no, the guys at Reprise Records are not paying
me for these blatant plugs!)

 "The Ram's Skull"

 There it sits on the table. 
 An exercise in metaphor. 
 Eyeholes vacant; 
 Overstated horns akimbo. 
 Ridiculous in death. 
 The tutor speaks: 
 "Forget reality. See shapes. See thoughts. 
 See half-formed visions of a greater consciousness.
 Just look and see and, having seen, say."

 They look. I look. We look,
 And one by one they speak,
 Saying they see landscapes, caverns and waterfalls,
 Great rocks and oceans and the homes of eagles.

 Now comes my turn: "Ann, tell us what you see."
 I see a ram's skull; heft it at arm's length,
 Ponder in pantomime,
 Then to the word-befuddled class declare
 "Alas, poor Herdwick!" - and they roar
 Till all that carefully constructed metaphor
 Falls like a clown's trousers round the tutor's feet.

 I feel myself dismissed -- his tight lips telegraph:
 "Trust you to settle for a cheap and easy laugh..." 
 Later, alone, I beg to contradict,
 Such laughs are easy but they don't come cheap.

 Who wants to be a poet anyway?
 Sometimes I hate poets. Hate them for not knowing
 The ram beneath the skull.

 A Swaledale tup.
 He'd have got bonny gimmers, this old chap -
 For old he was; some of his teeth are gone.
 See how the horns curl round and round again
 Finishing in the comic little lift
 Left over from his lambhood. Close and tight
 They sat upon his cheeks, trapping his head
 Till someone cut a slice from each of them
 To ease the workings of his mighty jaw.
 Somebody did a nifty hacksaw job;
 Somebody else sweated to hold him still,
 Digging their fingers into the greasy elf-locks,
 Pinning his ear back with a grubby thumb.

 Somebody cared. He'd not have lived so long
 Without a good master. All of seven-shear.
 Keen, too. See in one horn the drilled hole
 Where they close-coupled him to a companion.
 Ramshackled, lest they tupped the ewes too soon.

 Seven times a fleece fell, damp and rank-smelling,
 Stained with the old musk, bedewed on the skin side
 With his essential oils. Oh, the rare stink of him
 In the height of the season.

 And once, on a latefrost morning, he was new.
 Licked into life by an old blackfaced ewe.
 Perhaps a child fed him and knew the touch
 Of whiskery lips, the thrust of his blunt head.

 How could they look at a ram's skull and not see
 That once that skull would have been small enough
 To fit roundly, slick as a cricket ball,
 Into the cupped palm of a shepherd's hand.

	-- Ann Drysdale

I found the poem above while looking for information on the poet, who is
also an author of a book I am reading currently.  Ann Drysdale wrote 'Faint
Heart Never Kissed a Pig' while she was living at Hagg House Farm in
Yorkshire. It tells of her experiences as a novice farmer while also
bringing up her children as a single mother.  I think that some of her
difficulties arose because she tended to think of some of the livestock with
human thoughts and motives.

This way of thinking seems to come into play in the poem above. If I
understand correctly she gets the inspiration for the poem in a poetry
writing class situation, where the instructor has provided a ram's skull as
an exercise in metaphor.  She seems offended by the use of the skull in the
abstract and pricks the pomposity of the tutor.  She cares more to think of
the living, breathing creature who provided it and what his life had been.

I enjoy the mood created by her words and what comes through to me is the
respect I think she felt for provider of the skull. She made that ram live
again for me. 

Jann.

 "The Piano Has Been Drinking"

 The piano has been drinking, my necktie is asleep
 And the combo went back to New York, the jukebox has to take a leak
 And the carpet needs a haircut, and the spotlight looks like a prison break
 And the telephone's out of cigarettes, and the balcony is on the make
 And the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking...

 And the menus are all freezing, and the light man's blind in one eye
 And he can't see out of the other
 And the piano-tuner's got a hearing aid, and he showed up with his mother
 And the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking
 As the bouncer is a sumo wrestler cream-puff casper milktoast
 And the owner is a mental midget with the IQ of a fence post
 'cause the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking...

 And you can't find your waitress with a Geiger counter
 And she hates you and your friends and you just can't get served without
her
 And the box-office is drooling, and the bar stools are on fire
 And the newspapers were fooling, and the ash-trays have retired
 because the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking
 The piano has been drinking, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me... 

	-- Tom Waits
	From the album "Small Change", 1976.

Background Sketch:

Through most of his musical career, Tom Waits has combined a lyrical focus
on desperate, lowlife characters with a persona that seems to embody the
same lifestyle, which he sings about in a raspy, gravelly voice. This song
is track #5 on one of his earlier albums "Small Change" (1976). I find its
bitter-sweet combination of a down-and-out mood with a tumbling series of
humorous metaphors particularly picturesque. As he tumbles through the
lines, the poetry arises almost by accident - brought to life by the image
of a piano player singing in a run down bar.

There is underlying structure to his imagery: he brings you in to the room
with playful metaphors on physical objects that you would normally encounter
in a bar. The middle of the poem first turns introspective - the piano
players' crib with his mistuned piano, and then reaches out to grasp at lost
friendship. The persitent complaint of the drunk piano hangs the whole thing
together.

Having been born twenty years after 'Howl' was published, when growing up I
always felt envious of my elders for having missed out on the whole Beat
poetry phenomenon. To a lot of people my age, Tom Waits represents the
'post-Beat' experience - we are not directly connected to the events and
social conditions that inspired much of the beat generation. We arrived on
the scene when the Grateful Dead were just exiting - but the basic human
needs that Beat poetry spoke to still exist, and Tom Waits has managed, in
my opinion, to find a voice that speaks to those needs.

I was first introduced to Tom Waits through a documentary on Beat poetry
made by Ron Mann, called 'Poetry in Motion'. It's a somewhat iconoclastic
work, juxtaposing the likes of Allen Ginsberg with William S Burroughs, John
Cage, Micheal Ondaatje and Tom Waits. It brings home the message that as
much as we can appreciate poetry in written form, to hear a poet orating his
or her poem - often extempore, is an experience of an entirely different
kind. To me, the songs of Tom Waits epitomize poetry as an oral art form.
Some of his earlier songs were indeed recorded extempore - singing into a
ratty tape recorder sitting in his car driving across the california desert.

Of course, not all his songs are as dark - check out the playful 'Step Right
Up' on the same album "Small Change" or the laugh-out-loud funny 'Filipino
Box Spring Hog' on his recent album "Mule Variations". The latter is
especially funny given the story behind the song: it's a recounting of a
tradition he and his friends had of cooking up a hog strung on a trashed
box-spring in their penny-less youth.

Some informational links:

There's also a 'Poetry in Motion II', which covers the poets that were
filmed for the first documentary, but not included in it.

"Learning"
   
 I'm learning to say thank you.
 And I'm learning to say please.
 And I'm learning to use Kleenex,
 Not my sweater, when I sneeze.
 And I'm learning not to dribble.
 And I'm learning not to slurp.
 And I'm learning (though it sometimes really hurts me)
 Not to burp.
 And I'm learning to chew softer
 When I eat corn on the cob.
 And I'm learning that it's much
 Much easier to be a slob. 
 
   -- Judith Viorst 

I memorized Viorst's "Learning" with my third grade son and recited it in
front of his third grade class, with him.  What a pleasure to share it,
parenting the same child who memorized it with me, as he was actually
learning little nuances of polite living.

It was a class assignment, and all the children memorized something and then
stood to recite, some with their parents, some going it alone.

Public school teachers are unsung heroes.  I thank mine whenever I get the
chance.

And a bunch of them have put together poetry sites for the little guys.

"Blowin' in the Wind"

 How many roads must a man walk down
 Before you call him a man?
 Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
 Before she sleeps in the sand?
 Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
 Before they're forever banned?
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
 
 How many years can a mountain exist
 Before it's washed to the sea?
 Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
 Before they're allowed to be free?
 Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,
 And pretend he just doesn't see?
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
 
 How many times must a man look up
 Before he can see the sky?
 Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
 Before he can hear people cry?
 Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
 That too many people have died?
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
 
    -- Bob Dylan

If there's ever a song that cries out to be memorised - this is it. I
can still remember being nine years old and listening to it over and
over, trying to ensure that the words would stay in my head forever. It
wasn't just that the words were beautiful and moving (if anything the
message of war and oppression seemed far less relevant then - back in
the 80's, at the age of 9 - than it does now); it was that listening to
the rhythm of the questions and the soft strumming of the guitar and
that simple, weary, heartfelt and almost speaking voice that could only
be Dylan, I was discovering what poetry really was. Not just pretty
images and melodic rhymes, not just fine sounding words arranged in
neat stanzas, not just daffodils and boys on burning decks, but the
voice of a real person, an attitude, a way of looking at the world.

The folksy "Yes 'n"'s notwithstanding, this is a great poem. Not just
because the rhyme scheme works perfectly, and the pattern of three
repeated questions is brilliant and the metaphors are powerful and the
lines themselves are memorable; but because it's a collection of a few
simple words that has the power to reach out and grab you by the heart.
Because every time you see the war footage on CNN or the pictures from
Abu Ghraib or Sudan or 9/11, the words will come back to haunt you.
Because long after Dylan is dead generations of singers and activists
will find in these simple lyrics  a sense of understanding and the
courage to go on. Because this simple little song sums up the entire
history of the human endeavour: our struggle to define ourselves as
people, our quest for peace and our bewilderment at the world's
cruelty. Because there's something about this song that makes it an
authentic poetic experience, something that you can't pin down but
can't help feeling, something that is, well, "blowin' in the wind".

ENDPOEM submitted by Aseem Kaul, <mithwarg@yahoo.com>, an excerpt from:

 "Geetanjali"

  Obstinate are the trammels, but my heart aches when I try to break them. 
  Freedom is all I want, but to hope for it I feel ashamed. 
  I am certain that priceless wealth is in thee, and that thou art my best
friend, but I have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that fills my room

  The shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death; I hate it, yet
hug it in love. 
  My debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet when
I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted. 

	-- Rabindranath Tagore 

It's been a while since we did a Tagore poem (the last one was in Jan 2004),
so figured would send in one of my personal favourites. 

I'm not as a general rule a big Tagore fan. Maybe it's because as a true
city person I find all his bucolic charm difficult to relate to. Maybe it's
because I'm too cynical to approach simple beauty with anything but active
suspicion. Whatever the reason, I've always found him somewhat long-winded,
cloying and repetitive. I can open Geetanjali at random and read a poem or
two and be moved by them, but every time I've tried reading the whole thing
through I end up with a vaguely queasy feeling in my stomach - like eating
too many rosogullas. 

This poem is the one exception - it's a poem that I'm haunted by, a poem
whose very words have become almost a habit of thought (if we were still
running the 'poems you remember' theme, this one would qualify). Part of why
I like it is the abruptness of it - the lines here are short, the rhythm a
brisk point-counterpoint. Tagore doesn't go on and on, he deals instead in a
desperate precision that pierces straight to the heart. There is a sense (as
in all of Tagore's best work) of every word being carefully selected. As a
result, it is an intensely honest and heartfelt poem. If the real beauty of
Tagore is in his simplicity, then I can think of few better examples. 

But for all the simplicity of the language, it is also an extremely
difficult poem, because the mental state it describes - a sort of shrinking
away from hope and expectation - is a fundamentally complex, if a scarily
real one.  And that perhaps, is why it is my favourite Tagore poem - because
instead of expressing simple devotion or childish wonder (or muttering high
sounding platitudes - witness 'Where the mind is without fear', Poem #177),
Tagore gives us a portrait of a real state of mind, so that (for once) I
find myself truly able to relate to his work.

"A Dream Within a Dream"

 Take this kiss upon the brow!
 And, in parting from you now,
 Thus much let me avow --
 You are not wrong, who deem
 That my days have been a dream;
 Yet if hope has flown away
 In a night, or in a day,
 In a vision, or in none,
 Is it therefore the less gone?
 All that we see or seem
 Is but a dream within a dream.
 
 I stand amid the roar
 Of a surf-tormented shore,
 And I hold within my hand
 Grains of the golden sand --
 How few! yet how they creep
 Through my fingers to the deep,
 While I weep -- while I weep!
 O God! can I not grasp
 Them with a tighter clasp?
 O God! can I not save
 One from the pitiless wave?
 Is all that we see or seem
 But a dream within a dream?.

    -- Edgar Allan Poe

I'm rather astounded that Minstrels doesn't have this one already.  I love
this poem's sense of sad futility, the desire to save the moments of one's
life from slipping away before the dream of living is ended. The questions
raised cause me to look deep inside myself and ask "So, what's the purpose?
Is it real?"

I think many people have experienced that sensation of the time slipping
away from them, and wanting to slow it down, stop it. Unable to do so, we
stand there and let it slide through our fingers, losing precious moments
forever, unable to stop time's march.

And the question remains: Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a
dream? Nobody knows, everybody wonders. Maybe we find out when all of those
grains of sand have ended for each of us. Maybe not. It will be interesting
to find out.

 "warty bliggens the toad"

 i met a toad
 the other day by the name
 of warty bliggens
 he was sitting under 
 a toadstool
 feeling contented
 he explained that when the cosmos
 was created
 that toadstool was especially planned for his personal
 shelter from sun and rain
 thought out and prepared
 for him

 do not tell me
 said warty bliggens
 that there is not a purpose
 in the universe
 the thought is blasphemy

 a little more
 conversation revealed
 that warty bliggens
 considers himself to be
 the centre of the said
 universe
 the earth exists
 to grow toadstools for him
 to sit under
 the sun to give him light
 by day and the moon
 and wheeling constellations
 to make beautiful
 the night for the sake of
 warty bliggens

 to what act of yours
 do you impute
 this interest on the part
 of the creator
 of the universe
 i asked him
 why is it that you
 are so greatly favoured
  
 ask rather
 said warty bliggens
 what the universe has done to deserve me
 
 if i were a
 human being i would
 not laugh
 too complacently
 at poor warty bliggens
 for similar
 absurdities
 have only too often
 lodged in the crinkles
 of the human cerebrum

 archy

	-- Don Marquis
	From "archy and mehitabel", 1927.

I really enjoyed Saturday's grook.  It's great when something makes you
laugh out loud.  It put me immediately in mind of 'warty bliggens the toad'
by Don Marquis, which isn't on the Minstrels site yet, so I reproduce it
here in case Piet Hein triggers a rush of similar thoughts.

Back in the mists of time (the 70s) when I used to teach 11 year olds, we
always used to have fun with this poem.  It's like the tale of the Sunday
School teacher who is telling her group the parable Christ told of the
Pharisee and the tax collector (Luke 18: 9-14).

 'Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other
was a tax collector. The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this:
"God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners,
unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a
week. I give tithes of all that I get." But the tax collector, standing far
away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying,
"God, be merciful to me, a sinner!" I tell you, this man went down to his
house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will
be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.'

And then the teacher says to the children, "Now then, boys and girls, put
your hands together and let's all thank God that we're not like that smug
Pharisee!"

Cheers,
Martin Davis.

 "Fisher v. Lowe"

 A wayward Chevy struck a tree
 Whose owner sued defendants three.
 He sued car's owner, driver, too,
 And insurer for what was due
 For his oak tree that now may bear
 A lasting need for tender care.
 The Oakland County Circuit Court,
 John N. O'Brian, J., set forth
 The judgment that defendants sought,
 And quickly an appeal was brought.
 Court of Appeals, J.  H. Gillis, J.,
 Gave thought and then had this to say:
 1) There is no liability,
 Since No-Fault grants immunity,
 2) No jurisdiction can be found
 Where process service is unsound;
 And thus the judgment, as it's termed
 Is due to be, and is
 Affirmed.

 [1] AUTOMOBILES k251.13
 Defendant's Chevy struck a tree,
 There was no liability.
 The No-Fault Act comes into play,
 As owner and the driver say.
 Barred by the act's immunity,
 No suit in tort will aid the tree.
 Although the oak's in disarray,
 No court can make defendants pay.
  
 [2] PROCESS k4
 No jurisdiction could be found,
 Where process service is unsound.
 In personam jurisdiction
 Was not even legal fiction
 Where plaintiff failed to well comply
 With rules of court that did apply.

   * * *

 J. H. GILLIS, Judge.
 We thought that we would never see
 A suit to compensate a tree.
 A suit whose claim in tort is prest,
 Upon a mangled tree's behest;
 A tree whose battered trunk was prest
 Against a Chevy's crumpled crest;
 A tree that faces each new day
 With bark and limb in disarray;
 A tree that may forever bear
 A lasting need for tender care.
 Flora lovers though we three,
 We must affirm the court's decree.

 Affirmed.

	-- Michigan Court of Appeals

 333 N.W. 2d 67 (Mich. App. 1983) (footnotes (in prose) omitted).

 Yes, this is an honest-to-goodness Michigan appellate court decision.  It's
still valid (though uninteresting) law, too.
 
 It's not the only time a judge has been inspired by a funny or silly or (in
this case) wildly frivolous lawsuit to launch into verse.  After a few
years, the starchy style you're pretty much forced to accept as a jurist
really begins to drag on some people, I guess.  But this one's a rarity, for
the following reasons:  (1) Usually, any poetry is written by the dissent,
with the majority opinion written in boring prose.  (2) For some reason,
this time the verse was infectious:  Thanks to Gillis's opinion (offered
unanimously by the three-judge panel), the author of the syllabus (the first
bit) and the headnotes (the little blurb summary bits with the numbers) were
also inspired to rhyme.  Lastly, (3) it's one of the two examples I know of
where not only is the opinion in verse, it is also a direct parody of a
specific poem.  (There's also "In Re Love," 61 B.R. 558 (Bankr. S. D. Fla.
1986),  which is a very good parody of The Raven, but that doesn't really
count since it's not real law.  The opinion is the judge denying his own sua
sponte motion-in English instead of legalese, that means it's a pointless
activity for the sole purpose of producing an opinion with no possible legal
ramifications.)

 Ah, poetic justice.

'The Stories'
 
 I was unfaithful to you last week.
 Thought I tried to be true
 to the beautiful vagaries
 of our unauthorized love,
 I told a stranger our story,
 arranging and rearranging us
 until we were orderly, reduced.
 I didn't want to sleep with this stranger.
 I wanted, I think, to see her yield,
 to sense her body's musculature,
 her history of sane resistance
 become pliable, as yours had
 twenty-two years ago.
 I told her we met in parks
 and rest stops along highways.
 Once, deep in the woods,
 a blanket over stones and dirt.
 I said that you were, finally,
 my failure of nerve,
 made to the contours of my body,
 so wrongly good for me
 I had to give you up.
 Listening to myself, it seemed
 as if I were still inconsolable,
 and I knew the seductiveness in that,
 knew when she'd try to console me
 I'd allow her the tiniest of victories.
 I told her about Laguna, the ruins
 we made of each other.
 To be undone -- I said I learned
 that's what I'd always wanted.
 We were on a train from Boston
 to New York, this stanger and I,
 the compartment to ourselves.
 I don't have to point out to you
 the erotics of such a space.
 We'd been speaking of our marriages,
 the odd triumphs of their durations.
 "Once....," I said, and my betrayal began,
 and did not end.
 She had a story, too.
 Mine seemed to coax hers out.
 There was this man she'd meet
 every workday Thursday at noon.
 For three years, every Thursday
 except Thanksgiving. She couldn't
 bear it anymore, she said,
 the lies, the coming home.
 Ended, she said.
 Happiest years of my life, she said.
 At that moment (you understand)
 we had to hug, but that's all we did.
 It hardly matters. We were in each other's
 sanctums, among the keepsakes,
 we'd gone where most sex cannot go.
 I could say that telling her our story
 was a way of bringing you back to life,
 and for a while it was, a memorial
 made of memory and its words.
 But here's what I knew:
 Watching her react, I was sure I'd tell
 our story again, to others. I understood
 how it could be taken to the bank,
 and I feared I might not ever again
 feel enough to know when to stop.
  
   -- Stephen Dunn

I once watched in stunned silence as a girl in our bus gave the driver a
detailed account of what was going wrong in her life. It made me wince.. and
also wonder if it's somehow easier for people to reveal their innermost
thoughts and fears to absolute strangers ?
 
Do public dissemblers feel embarrassed later on? Does talking in public
help them gain a new perspective.. or is it merely addictive? Trust Stephen
Dunn to come up with a beautiful poem on the topic. 
 
The day a cherished memory becomes an 'orderly, reduced' story, something
has slowly, but surely, changed..

 "Mahi-Mahi"

 Better than a William Carlos Williams poem.

Mahi-mahi[1] ("strong-strong" in Hawai'ian) is a sweet tropical fish also

Or, you can buy seasoned fillets of it at Trader Joe's. Delicious!

This poem is from Mairead Byrne's blog, Heaven[3]. It made me laugh because
it's a parody on WCW's shorter poems, like "The Red Wheelbarrow" or "This is
just to say." I guess it takes a poetry geek like me to think anything of
this poem, and I thought I would share it with the other poetry geeks out
there on the minstrels list!

Mairead Byrne is an Irish poet who now teaches at the Rhode Island School of
Design in Providence. More about her can be found at her home page at

 "Introduction To Poetry"
 
 I ask them to take a poem 
 and hold it up to the light 
 like a color slide 

 or press an ear against its hive. 

 I say drop a mouse into a poem 
 and watch him probe his way out, 

 or walk inside the poem's room 
 and feel the walls for a light switch. 

 I want them to waterski 
 across the surface of a poem 
 waving at the author's name on the shore. 

 But all they want to do 
 is tie the poem to a chair with rope 
 and torture a confession out of it. 

 They begin beating it with a hose

'The Invaders'

 Coming by night, furtively, one by one
 They infiltrate according to the Plan,
 Their orders memorized and their disguise
 Impenetrable. With the rising sun
 Our citizens welcome them. Nobody can
 Think that such charming creatures might be spies.
 
 So feeble, so helpless, no one could suspect
 They come to make this commonwealth their prey;
 So few, they pose no threat; their cohort grows
 So imperceptibly that we neglect
 To notice how it musters day by day
 And, unalarmed, we watch as they impose
 
 Themselves, make friends in all directions, take
 Impressions of all keys. They gain access
 To all our secrets; learn to speak our tongue
 Like natives; profit by each false move we make;
 Work on our weaknesses; observe and guess
 The sources of power and study them to be strong.
 
 And when it happens, there will be no fuss,
 No streets running with blood, no barricade.
 We shall simply wake one morning to discover,
 As those who ruled this city before us
 Found by each door a headstone and a spade,
 That a new generation has taken over.
 
 	-- A. D. Hope

This poem by Australian poet A.D. Hope (1907-2000) is based on an utterly
simple idea, with an underlying tension (even menace) beautifully developed,
and brilliantly resolved in the final line. Like Hope's "Ode on the Death of
Pius the Twelfth" [1] this poem deals with the issue of age and death, which
are recurrent themes for Hope (see also [2]) -- as they are, of course, for
many poets.

The poem is from A.D. Hope, A Late Picking: Poems 1965-1974. (Sydney: Angus
& Robertson, 1975)

 "Diving into the Wreck"

 First having read the book of myths,
 and loaded the camera,
 and checked the edge of the knife-blade,
 I put on
 the body-armor of black rubber
 the absurd flippers
 the grave and awkward mask.
 I am having to do this
 not like Cousteau with his
 assiduous team
 aboard the sun-flooded schooner
 but here alone.

 There is a ladder.
 The ladder is always there
 hanging innocently
 close to the side of the schooner.
 We know what it is for,
 we who have used it.
 Otherwise
 it is a piece of maritime floss
 some sundry equipment.

 I go down.
 Rung after rung and still
 the oxygen immerses me
 the blue light
 the clear atoms
 of our human air.
 I go down.
 My flippers cripple me,
 I crawl like an insect down the ladder
 and there is no one
 to tell me when the ocean
 will begin.

 First the air is blue and then
 it is bluer and then green and then
 black I am blacking out and yet
 my mask is powerful
 it pumps my blood with power
 the sea is another story
 the sea is not a question of power
 I have to learn alone
 to turn my body without force
 in the deep element.

 And now: it is easy to forget
 what I came for
 among so many who have always
 lived here
 swaying their crenellated fans
 between the reefs
 and besides
 you breathe differently down here.

 I came to explore the wreck.
 The words are purposes.
 The words are maps.
 I came to see the damage that was done
 and the treasures that prevail.
 I stroke the beam of my lamp
 slowly along the flank
 of something more permanent
 than fish or weed

 the thing I came for:
 the wreck and not the story of the wreck
 the thing itself and not the myth
 the drowned face always staring
 toward the sun
 the evidence of damage
 worn by salt and away into this threadbare beauty
 the ribs of the disaster
 curving their assertion
 among the tentative haunters.

 This is the place.
 And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair
 streams black, the merman in his armored body.
 We circle silently
 about the wreck
 we dive into the hold.
 I am she: I am he

 whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes
 whose breasts still bear the stress
 whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies
 obscurely inside barrels
 half-wedged and left to rot
 we are the half-destroyed instruments
 that once held to a course
 the water-eaten log
 the fouled compass

 We are, I am, you are
 by cowardice or courage
 the one who find our way
 back to this scene
 carrying a knife, a camera
 a book of myths
 in which
 our names do not appear.

	-- Adrienne Rich

I remember studying this in college and loving the way the poem draws the
reader in... just as the poet is diving so are you. There have been many
interpretaions of what the diver is looking for; the wreck has been called
the bulk of sexual definitions of the past, the treasure has been seen to be
knowledge, the book of myths patriarchy itself.

But I like to see the peom as one of transformation: the diver almost
'becomes' an androgyne, land is transformed into ocean, even breathing is
different there... the ocean changes from blue, green to black and the
shipwreck takes on mythical connotations. It is a journey of self-discovery
in more ways than one. There is a quest, a treasure and the journey she/he
makes is into the past, to look beyond myths and discover the truth behind
the wreckage.

Hope you enjoy the poem.

Janice.

"I Do Not Love You Except Because I Love You"

 I do not love you except because I love you;
 I go from loving to not loving you,
 From waiting to not waiting for you
 My heart moves from cold to fire.
 
 I love you only because it's you the one I love;
 I hate you deeply, and hating you
 Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
 Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.
 
 Maybe January light will consume
 My heart with its cruel
 Ray, stealing my key to true calm.
 
 In this part of the story I am the one who
 Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,
 Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood.
 
    -- Pablo Neruda
    (translator unknown)

I first came across NerudaÂs poetry when I was in college. We studied him as
part of the syllabus. Though poetry was never one of my favourite subjects,
I found that I liked Neruda. There is something about the way he wrote that
just captivates the reader, even a lay one like me.
 
This poem quickly entered my halls of poetical fame because on some level I
identified with the very literal movement from intense love to hatred and
back again that the poem portrays.

I am afraid thatÂs the best - and I know it is not nearly enough - I can do
here. I hope those of you who read it, also fall in love with it the way I
have.

 "Planting a Sequoia"

 All afternoon my brothers and I have worked in the orchard,
 Digging this hole, laying you into it, carefully packing the soil.
 Rain blackened the horizon, but cold winds kept it over the Pacific,
 And the sky above us stayed the dull gray
 Of an old year coming to an end.

 In Sicily a father plants a tree to celebrate his first son's birth-
 An olive or a fig tree-a sign that the earth has one more life to bear.
 I would have done the same, proudly laying new stock into my father's
orchard,
 A green sapling rising among the twisted apple boughs,
 A promise of new fruit in other autumns.

 But today we kneel in the cold planting you, our native giant,
 Defying the practical custom of our fathers,
 Wrapping in your roots a lock of hair, a piece of an infant's birth cord,
 All that remains above earth of a first-born son,
 A few stray atoms brought back to the elements.

 We will give you what we can-our labor and our soil,
 Water drawn from the earth when the skies fail,
 Nights scented with the ocean fog, days softened by the circuit of bees.
 We plant you in the corner of the grove, bathed in western light,
 A slender shoot against the sunset.

 And when our family is no more, all of his unborn brothers dead,
 Every niece and nephew scattered, the house torn down,
 His mother's beauty ashes in the air,
 I want you to stand among strangers, all young and ephemeral to you,
 Silently keeping the secret of your birth.

	-- Dana Gioia

To me, this is so moving.  You can sense the grief in the rythym of the
lines.  I like the way Gioia uses the customs of a new birth to contrast
with their remembrance of their child.  The use of weather is evocative,
too.  It is cold winds that hold off the blackness.  The other thing which
strikes me is the how the solidity and age of the Sequoia is set against the
very short life of their son.
 
It suprised me to find that any of Gioia's poems haven't been included
already.  I discovered him when listening to 'Money' on the BBC Radio 4
program "Poetry Please", a great program based entirely on viewers
recommendations.

 "Silence"

 My father used to say,
 "Superior people never make long visits,
 have to be shown Longfellow's grave
 nor the glass flowers at Harvard.
 Self reliant like the cat --
 that takes its prey to privacy,
 the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth --
 they sometimes enjoy solitude,
 and can be robbed of speech
 by speech which has delighted them.
 The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence;
 not in silence, but restraint."
 Nor was he insincere in saying, "Make my house your inn."
 Inns are not residences.

	-- Marianne Moore

Such a wonderfully exact poem this. I love that it expresses so precisely
the attitude one has (or would like to have) towards guests, but manages, in
a brief 14 lines, to be both profound ("The deepest feeling always shows
itself in silence / not in silence, but restraint" [1]) and so brilliantly
visual ("the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth"). To
read Moore is to have the sense of language being carefully polished, of the
importance of ideas as subject matter for poetry. This poem, with its quiet,
balanced tone, captures that so perfectly. 

Aseem

 "Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"

 I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,
 your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,
 yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new,
 in city and in forest they smiled like me and you,
 but now it's come to distances and both of us must try,
 your eyes are soft with sorrow,
 Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

 I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time,
 walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
 you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,
 it's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea,
 but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,
 your eyes are soft with sorrow,
 Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

	-- Leonard Cohen

I have hesitated for a long time to send this. One associates Cohen with the
haunting lyrics of Suzanne (Poem #116, where his bio is also included) or
his other songs (some of which are already on the Minstrels) and this poem
is mushy by comparision. But I'm encouraged by Martin's comment that
"sometimes even a single line" can make a poem. And ever since I first came
across the line "It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the
sea" more than three decades ago, it has stuck in my mind as an example of
'sheer poetry'. What a simple but brilliant analogy of constant change in
togetherness.

 "Don't let that horse"
   
   Don't let that horse

 And became famous
 And kept on painting
                   The Horse With Violin In Mouth
 And when he finally finished it
 he jumped up upon the horse
                  and rode away
         waving the violin
 And then with a low bow gave it
 to the first naked nude he ran across
 And there were no strings

I was surprised to see that only two of Ferlinghetti's poems have made it to
minstrels.  He's my favorite of the Beat poets, and this is one of my
favorite poems of his.  I love his exuberance and the sheer *fun* of his
poems.  In this one I admire his ability to use humor without snarkiness, to
convey the joy of creation of art.  I saw him read this one when I was in
high school.  I can still see his smile at the last line and hear the
audience's happy laughter.

 "In Praise of Feeling Bad About Yourself"
 
 The buzzard never says it is to blame.
 The panther wouldn't know what scruples mean.
 When the piranha strikes, it feels no shame.
 If snakes had hands, they'd claim their hands were clean. 

 A jackal doesn't understand remorse.
 Lions and lice don't waver in their course.
 Why should they, when they know they're right?

 Though hearts of killer whales may weigh a ton,
 in every other way they're light. 

 On this third planet of the sun
 among the signs of bestiality
 a clear conscience is Number One.
 
	-- Wislawa Szymborska 
	Translated by Stanislaw Baraczak and Clare Cavanagh.
 
This poem is straightforward and needs no interpretation. Wislawa Szymborska
writes simple poems that have a touch of the profound. This poem falls
neatly in that category.
 
Sachin Desai.

[thomas adds]

Sachin is exactly correct: Szymborska's poem seems simple enough on the
surface, but is touched by the profound. Specifically, I wonder to what
extent the poet is being ironic. It's almost a cliche to state that humans
are the only animals possesed of a conscience, and hence that they are in
some sense "superior" to mere beasts. And indeed, that's what today's poem
says, taken at face value. 

But is that all there is to it? After all, one could argue that lions and
lice may "know they're right" simply because they *are* right: it is in
their nature to kill wildebeest or suck blood. Hence they should *not* feel
remorse or shame. Whereas humans can and often do do things which later
prick their conscience; feeling scruples afterward may be "civilized", but
it doesn't alter the deed itself. So perhaps humans are the more guilty ones
after all? 

I'm reminded of this little gem by D. H. Lawrence, contrasting two types of
bloodsucker:

 "The Mosquito Knows"

 The mosquito knows full well, small as he is
 he's a beast of prey.
 But after all
 he only takes his bellyful,
 he doesn't put my blood in the bank.

 "The Ways We Touch"

 Have compassion for everyone you meet, 
 even if they don't want it. 
 What appears bad manners, an ill temper or cynicism 
 is always a sign of things no ears have heard, 
 no eyes have seen. 
 You do not know what wars are going on down there where the spirit meets
the bone.

	-- Miller Williams

I have recently moved to Nashville, Tennessee - the home of country music. I
was fortunate on my first night in town to see a rare performance by
singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams and her father, poet Miller Williams
called 'Poetry Said, Poetry Sung'. Miller Williams recited a poem and
Lucinda picked a song to play that would fit the poem her dad had just read.


His poems really spoke to me and I went to the library the following day to
look for his work. On reading a few poems from 'Points of Departure' and
'Some Jazz a While', I was disappointed that the poems did not have such an
impact on me as they did when they were spoken by Miller the night before. I
fear this may happen with readers as well so I ask that you imagine an old,
grey man of slight stature and big glasses, whose body rocks when he laughs
and whose voice crackles when he talks ever so slowly. A man who knows of
struggle and loss. At one point during the show Lucinda said "Takes me
longer to say in a song what dad can do in a few lines." I think this is so
very true. For me, 'The Ways We Touch' was made to be spoken. 

To experience Miller Williams, click on this videolink:

Miller was chosen to read a poem at Bill Clinton's innaugauration in 1997
('Of History and Hope').

 "Refugee Blues"

 Say this city has ten million souls
 Some are living in mansions, some are living in holes:
 Yet there's no place for us, my dear, yet there's no place for us.

 Once we had a country and we thought it fair,
 Look in the atlas and you'll find it there:
 We cannot go there now, my dear, we cannot go there now.

 In the village churchyard there grows an old yew,
 Every spring it blossoms anew:
 Old passports can't do that, my dear, old passports can't do that.

 The consul banged the table and said,
 "If you've got no passport you're officially dead":
 But we are still alive, my dear, but we are still alive.

 Went to a committee; they offered me a chair;
 Asked me politely to return next year:
 But where whall we go to-day, my dear, but where shall we go to-day?

 Came to a public meeting; the speaker got up and said;
 "If we let them in, they will steal our daily bread":
 He was talking of you and me, my dear, he was talking of you and me.

 Thought I heard the thunder rumbling in the sky;
 It was Hitler over Europe, saying, "They must die":
 O we were in is mind, my dear, O we were in his mind.

 Saw a poodle in a jacket fastened with a pin,
 Saw a door opened and a cat let in:
 But they weren't German Jews, my dear, but they weren't German Jews.

 Went down the harbour and stood upon the quay,
 Saw the fish swimming if they were free:
 Only ten feet away, my dear, only ten feet away.

 Walked through a wood, saw birds in the trees;
 They had no politicians and sang at their ease:
 They weren't the human race, my dear, they weren't the human race.

 Dreamed I saw a building with a thousand floors,
 A thousand windows and a thousand doors:
 Not one of them was ours, my dear, not one of them was ours.

 Stood on a great plain in the falling snow;
 Ten thousand soldiers marched to and fro:
 Looking for you and me, my dears, looking for you and me.

	-- W. H. Auden

This poem first struck my attention in the fall of 2003, when I was engaged
in preparation for the university-entrance diploma exams. Second, I was
getting to know my girlfriend then, for whom I translated it into German. A
few people said I was fallen in love when they read the translation, and
they were right.

What Auden conveys so convincingly is the apparent futileness of intellect
in face of circumstances like the mass extermination of Jews during the
Second World War; and because most of the killed Jews have not been
intellectual masterminds like Auden was, he correctly puts the words on the
tongue of laymen: They can't understand anything about their doom, because
doom just waits for them. They resort to analogies they understand (birds,
fishes, the lameness of bureaucracy) and know how to use them - but they use
them with striking efficacy.

David Croll.

[thomas adds]

Vikram Doctor's commentary on Poem #427, "The Two", is worth reproducing
here: 

	The other Auden poems we've had so far show his lyrical
 	side or his questioning intelligence. But this poem has
 	another aspect of Auden's - the ability to create a 
	picture of nightmarish fear, of being hunted and pursued, 
	of having 'them' after you. Not for nothing is Auden the 
	dominant poet of the Thirties, the worst, most frightening
	and disturbed decade of our century. The Depression, the
	rise of fascism and other tyrannies, all the cowardices 
	and compromises of what he called 'a low dishonest decade',
	it all seeps into Auden's verse, and what he does with it
	is unforgettable.

"Windows is Shutting Down"

Windows is shutting down, and grammar are 
On their last leg. So what am we to do?
A letter of complaint go just so far,
Proving the only one in step are you.

Better, perhaps, to simply let it goes.
A sentence have to be screwed pretty bad 
Before they gets to where you doesnt knows 
The meaning what it must of meant to had.

The meteor have hit. Extinction spread,
But evolution do not stop for that.
A mutant languages rise from the dead
And all them rules is suddenly old hat.

Too bad for we, us what has had so long
The best seat from the only game in town.
But there it am, and whom can say its wrong?
Those are the break. Windows is shutting down.

	-- Clive James

Clive James is an illustrious expatriate Australian poet and author
living in London. The title (and opening phrase) of his poem will be
familiar to everyone reading these words. I've read them often enough
myself, but it has taken James's wit to point out how they should have
grated painfully on my grammatical ear. It is a marvellously chosen
example to illustrate his claim about declining grammatical standards,
since digital technology has been such a powerful force for generating
mangled syntax. There are many fine essays on the decline of the English
language: George Orwell's 'Politics and the English Language' remains
one of the best. This poem is a companion piece to James's own lament on
the subject. The poem states James's argument more succinctly than the
delightful accompanying essay, 'The Continuing Insult to the Language',
both of which are published in 'The Monthly', June 2006.

 "To Raja Rao"

 Raja, I wish I knew 
 the cause of that malady. 

 For years I could not accept 
 the place I was in. 
 I felt I should be somewhere else. 

 A city, trees, human voices 
 lacked the quality of presence. 
 I would live by the hope of moving on. 

 Somewhere else there was a city of real presence, 
 of real trees and voices and friendship and love. 

 Link, if you wish, my peculiar case 
 (on the border of schizophrenia) 
 to the messianic hope 
 of my civilization. 

 Ill at ease in the tyranny, ill at ease in the republic, 
 in the one I longed for freedom, in the other for the end of
corruption. 
 Building in my mind a permanent polis 
 forever deprived of aimless bustle. 

 I learned at last to say: this is my home, 
 here, before the glowing coal of ocean sunsets, 
 on the shore which faces the shores of your Asia, 
 in a great republic, moderately corrupt. 

 Raja, this did not cure me 
 of my guilt and shame. 
 A shame of failing to be 
 what I should have been. 

 The image of myself 
 grows gigantic on the wall 
 and against it 
 my miserable shadow. 

 That's how I came to believe 
 in Original Sin 
 which is nothing but the first 
 victory of the ego. 

 Tormented by my ego, deluded by it 
 I give you, as you see, a ready argument. 
 
 I hear you saying that liberation is possible 
 and that Socratic wisdom 
 is identical with your guru's. 

 No, Raja, I must start from what I am. 
 I am those monsters which visit my dreams 
 and reveal to me my hidden essence. 

 If I am sick, there is no proof whatsoever 
 that man is a healthy creature. 

 Greece had to lose, her pure consciousness 
 had to make our agony only more acute. 

 We needed God loving us in our weakness 
 and not in the glory of beatitude. 

 No help, Raja, my part is agony, 
 struggle, abjection, self-love, and self-hate, 
 prayer for the Kingdom 
 and reading Pascal. 

	-- Czeslaw Milosz
	(Berkeley, 1969 ) 

I stumbled upon this poem(and Milosz) when searching for the writer Raja
Rao. By far one of the most brilliant that I have read, and it brings
forth the best of Milosz. (Raja Rao was a great Indian writer, and with
R. K. Narayan and Mulk Raj Anand considered one of the trinity of Indian
writers in english.) 
 
To me some of the elements of the poem come from the time Milosz spent
his time at Berkeley away from his native place Poland, like the first
part. But the poem is also an accurate description of the struggle with
the present, and the hope for a change that changes everything. Two
striking ideas -- original sin and "...I must start from where I am...",
I really love the way they are written here.
 
An absolutely amazing poem in my book.
 
Prashant.

"A Reminiscence of Cricket"
 
 Once in my heyday of cricket,
 One day I shall ever recall!
 I captured that glorious wicket,
 The greatest, the grandest of all.
 
 Before me he stands like a vision,
 Bearded and burly and brown,
 A smile of good humoured derision
 As he waits for the first to come down.
 
 A statue from Thebes or from Knossos,
 A Hercules shrouded in white,
 Assyrian bull-like colossus,
 He stands in his might.
 
 With the beard of a Goth or a Vandal,
 His bat hanging ready and free,
 His great hairy hands on the handle,
 And his menacing eyes upon me.
 
 And I - I had tricks for the rabbits,
 The feeble of mind or eye,
 I could see all the duffer's bad habits
 And where his ruin might lie.
 
 The capture of such might elate one,
 But it seemed like one horrible jest
 That I should serve tosh to the great one,
 Who had broken the hearts of the best.
 
 Well, here goes! Good Lord, what a rotter!
 Such a sitter as never was dreamt;
 It was clay in the hands of the potter,
 But he tapped it with quiet contempt.
 
 The second was better - a leetle;
 It was low, but was nearly long-hop;
 As the housemaid comes down on the beetle
 So down came the bat with a chop.
 
 He was sizing me up with some wonder,
 My broken-kneed action and ways;
 I could see the grim menace from under
 The striped peak that shaded his gaze.
 
 The third was a gift or it looked it-
 A foot off the wicket or so;
 His huge figure swooped as he hooked it,
 His great body swung to the blow.
 
 Still when my dreams are night-marish,
 I picture that terrible smite,
 It was meant for a neighboring parish,
 Or any place out of sight.
 
 But - yes, there's a but to the story -
 The blade swished a trifle too low;
 Oh wonder, and vision of glory!
 It was up like a shaft from a bow.
 
 Up, up like a towering game bird,
 Up, up to a speck in the blue,
 And then coming down like the same bird,
 Dead straight on the line that it flew.
 
 Good Lord, it was mine! Such a soarer
 Would call for a safe pair of hands;
 None safer than Derbyshire Storer,
 And there, face uplifted, he stands
 
 Wicket keep Storer, the knowing,
 Wary and steady of nerve,
 Watching it falling and growing
 Marking the pace and curve.
 
 I stood with my two eyes fixed on it,
 Paralysed, helpless, inert;
 There was 'plunk' as the gloves shut upon it,
 And he cuddled it up to his shirt.
 
 Out - beyond question or wrangle!
 Homeward he lurched to his lunch!
 His bat was tucked up at an angle,
 His great shoulders curved to a hunch.
 
 Walking he rumbled and grumbled,
 Scolding himself and not me;
 One glove was off, and he fumbled,
 Twisting the other hand free
 
 Did I give Storer the credit
 The thanks he so splendidly earned?
 It was mere empty talk if I said it,
 For Grace had already returned.
 
   -- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 

I've been proud of having known this poem since I stumbled across it in an
unexpected corner of an obscure cricket anthology back in college, primarily
because this is one of those pieces that everyone has heard of but hardly
anyone has read, because it's not easy to come by. Its significance is much
like that of a precious antique, which in a way is its shortcoming, for it
takes a while to look beyond the historical significance - the fact that
Conan Doyle wrote this about his only first class wicket - of WG Grace, and
appreciate it for its rhythm, its poetic beauty.

I've read it very often since then, and looking back I see I've loved it
primarily because of the allure of an amateur lifestyle that it portrays -
an age where you could study medicine, play first class cricket, referee
boxing bouts and marathons, and still produce brilliant literature, when you
could live without sacrificing any dimension of your life, without putting
your head down to specialize in any one field, when you did something simply
because you loved it without having to forfeit other aspects of your life
that you loved just as much. It makes you long for a lifestyle with such
freedom.

This reminded me of a prose piece by Arthur Mailey, "Conquering my Hero" (I
think; not sure if I remember the title right), on how he got Victor Trumper
out in a club cricket match - which I loved for giving a close up, personal
view of what's otherwise an ordinary club game, in much the same way as this
poem, even though the tone of the other piece is altogether different.
 
The tone of the poem too indicates that you could do something for fun,
without taking yourself too seriously, which sounds incredible in an age of
almost totally professionalized sport (and life). The rhythm of the lines,
the self-deprecatory tone, the short-story-ish flow, and the almost
microscopic focus on a single over of the game - all make this a lovable
poem.
 
Regards,
Shamanth

[Addendum]

Bill Frindall of BBC Sports had some more detail about the historic wicket,
in response to a reader who asked "I once heard that a famous author took a
single wicket, that of W.G. Grace, and wrote a poem about it. Who was it? My
best guess is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.":

  And a very good guess too, Lavanya. It was indeed the creator of Sherlock
  Holmes, Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, who played in ten first-class
  matches, mainly for the MCC, between 1900 and 1907.
  
  A lower-order right-handed batsman and occasional slow bowler, he scored
  231 runs, average 19.25, in 18 innings with a top score of 43. His only
  first-class wicket came against London County at Crystal Palace on 25
  August 1900 when he had WG caught by the wicket-keeper off a skier for
  110.

"The Pub with No Beer"

 It's lonesome away from your kindred and all 
 By the camp fire at night where the wild dingoes call, 
 But there's nothing so lonesome so morbid or drear 
 Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer. 
 
 Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come 
 There's a far away look on the face of the bum 
 The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer 
 What a terrible place is a pub with no beer. 
 
 Then the stock-man rides up with his dry dusty throat 
 He breasts up to the bar, pulls a wad from his coat, 
 But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer, 
 When the bar man said sadly "The pub's got no beer".
 
 There's a dog on the 'randah for his master he waits 
 But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates 
 He hurries for cover and cringes in fear 
 It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer. 
 
 Old Billy the blacksmith first time in his life 
 Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife, 
 He walks in the kitchen, she says "You're early, me dear", 
 But then he breaks down and he tells her "The pub's got no beer".
 
   -- Gordon Parsons

Note: Based on Dan Sheahan's poem "A Pub Without Beer", and sung to the tune
of "Beautiful Dreamer" 

Following up on the outback poem, and not summer per se.  I wonder how many
people remember this song - from the 60s - !?

It was a top hit on the Binaca Hit Parade (Obviously it was also a #1 hit in
Australia and the UK!) - how many people remember this English countdown by
the late Hamid (Hameed?) Sayani - older brother of Ameen Sayani, who
compered the Hindi countdown Binaca Geet Mala on Radio Ceylon?

Hamid also anchored the Cadbury Amateur Hour, where budding singers could
exercise their vocal chords.

Hamid Sayani was killed in the Air India plane crash in Bombay in - was it
the New Year's day crash of 1978? Can't seem to find it on the web. This
great and lovable personality seems to have left almost no footprint on the
web.

Delhi AIR's own response to Radio Ceylon was "A Date with You" on Friday
evenings, and Hamid also compered this show. On Madras AIR, I can't remember
the name of the show, but the compere was Gayathri Krishnaswamy nee Grace
Adiappa.

India had other radio greats like Laurence "Bobby" Clark (?), Melville
D'Mello, Roshan Menon, Lotika Ratnam, .. to name just a few. And there is
almost nothing to be learned about them on the web.

"Question"

 God, again and again through the ages you have sent messengers
   To this pitiless world
 They have said, 'Forgive everyone', they have said, 'Love one another --
   Rid your hearts of evil.'
 They are revered and remembered, yet still in these dark days
 We turn them away with hollow greetings, from outside the doors of our houses.
 
 And meanwhile I see secretive hatred murdering the helpless
   Under cover of night;
 And Justice weeping silently and furtively at power misused,
   No hope of redress.
 I see young men working themselves into a frenzy,
 In agony dashing their heads against stone to no avail.
 
 My voice is choked today; I have no music in my flute:
   Black moonless night
 Has imprisoned my world, plunged it into nightmare. And this is why,
   With tears in my eyes, I ask:
 Those who have poisoned your air, those who have extinguished your light,
 Can it be that you have forgiven them? Can it be that you love them?

     -- Rabindranath Tagore

I'm quite new to Tagore's work, but bought a book[1] of his poetry recently,
mainly because I found this one whilst flicking through it at the book shop.
The poem was written just after Gandhi's arrest following the break down of
the Second Round Table Conference in London, but is not really about any one
particular event or time. It seems very relevant at the moment, with Iraq,
Lebanon, and the terrorist attacks on London (successful and unsuccessful).

The notes[1] comment that the 'vulnerable, bewildered human being in Tagore
was increasingly to be the subject of his later poetry; but he never lapsed
into self-pity. The precision and vigour of the rhythm and phrasing of this
poem belie its content. A famous reading of it by Tagore himself on record
conveys strength not weakness, despair not courage. There is even a note of
wryness in his voice'.

As an extra note, the notes say that the phase 'dashing their heads against
stone' is a Bengali metaphor for fruitless activity, much like the English
'beating one's head against a brick wall'.

"The Sonnet"

 Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frown'd,
   Mindless of its just honours; with this key
   Shakespeare unlock'd his heart; the melody
 Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;
 A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
   With it CamÃ¶ens sooth'd an exile's grief;
   The Sonnet glitter'd a gay myrtle leaf
 Amid the cypress with which Dante crown'd
 His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,
   It cheer'd mild Spenser, call'd from Faery-land
 To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
   Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
 The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
 Soul-animating strains -- alas, too few!
 
   -- William Wordsworth

Here's Wordsworth's famous defence of the sonnet, followed by a 
playful but thought-provoking parody by Dickinson: 
 
  'Scorn not the sonnet' (Wordsworth)
  
  Scorn not the sonnet on the sonnet, critic;
    It is a bank where poets love to lie
    And praise each other's ingenuity
  In finding such a form. The analytic
  Reader may stigmatise as parasitic
    The mirror-image of a mystery,
    The echo of lost voices, find it dry,
  And intellectually paralytic.
    Yet 'tis a child of Fancy, light and live,
  A fragile veil of Nature, scarcely worn
    (Of Wordsworth's two, of Shakespeare's none, survive);
  Empty not then the vials of scorn upon it.
    Nor, since we're on the subject, should you scorn
  The sonnet on the sonnet on the sonnet.
  
  - Peter Dickinson

The latter notes that Wordsworth, who wrote more than 500 sonnets in his
lifetime, produced two of these 'meta-sonnets' (the other being 'Nuns Fret
Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room') and Shakespeare, who wrote 154, none at
all.

Dickinson's selection of rhymes for 'critic' - and the self-referential
closing couplet - may raise a smile. One has to wonder what Wordsworth, ever
the serious Romantic, would have made of his "parasitic ingenuity".

Paul

[Martin adds]

The final two lines of Dickinson's parody are absolutely brilliant. I wonder
why Unauthorized Versions[1] didn't pick this one up.

[1] an absolutely delightful anthology of poems paired with their parodies,
which both Thomas and I are huge fans of. We once ran a theme based on the
book (see links), which today's pair of poems would have fitted very nicely
into.

"Christ in the Universe"

 With this ambiguous earth
 His dealings have been told us. These abide:
 The signal to a maid, the human birth,
 The lesson, and the young Man crucified.
 But not a star of all
 The innumerable host of stars has heard
 How He administered this terrestrial ball.
 Our race have kept their LordÂ¿s entrusted Word.
 Of His earth-visiting feet
 None knows the secret, cherished, perilous,
 The terrible, shamefast, frightened, whispered, sweet
 Heart-shattering secret of His way with us.
 No planet knows that this
 Our wayside planet, carrying land and wave,
 Love and life multiplied, and pain and bliss,
 Bears, as chief treasure, one forsaken grave.
 Nor, in our little day,
 May His devices with the heavens be guessed,
 His pilgrimage to thread the Milky Way
 Or His bestowals there be manifest.
 But in the eternities,
 Doubtless we shall compare together, hear
 A million alien Gospels, in what guise
 He trod the Pleiades, the Lyre, the Bear.
 O, be prepared, my soul!
 To read the inconceivable, to scan
 The million forms of God those stars unroll
 When, in our turn, we show to them a Man.
 
    -- Alice Meynell 

As a convinced atheist of many years I had often wondered how Christians
reconciled their belief in an all-knowing all-powerful universe-wide God,
with what they believed to be its (his?) interest in, and manifestation in
our parochial little planet, with all its peculiarities of biology and
geography - almost all of them unlikely to be repeated anywhere else in the 
universe.

Alice Meynell tackled this problem head-on, walking over it as though it 
didn't exist.

'Untitled'

 When the heart
 Is cut or cracked or broken
 Do not clutch it
 Let the wound lie open
 Let the wind
 From the good old sea blow in
 To bathe the wound with salt
 
 Let a stray dog lick it
 Let a bird lean in the hole and sing
 A simple song like a tiny bell
 And let it ring
 Let it go.  Let it out.
 Let it all unravel.
 Let it free and it can be
 A path on which to travel.
 
   -- Michael Leunig

This is a poem without a title, by the Australian writer, poet, cartoonist,
philosopher, Michael Leunig. I first discovered Leunig about 10 years ago
when a cousin gifted me one of his books, I have followed his work ever
since and have always found it endearing and enchanting. Like this poem
here, he talks of simple things around us, within us and talks of them in an
amazingly simple and human way; and reading his work mostly opens a tiny
window somewhere in the heart.

I hope everyone enjoys this!

 "The Year" 

 What can be said in New Year rhymes,
 That's not been said a thousand times?
 The new years come, the old years go,
 We know we dream, we dream we know.
 We rise up laughing with the light,
 We lie down weeping with the night.
 We hug the world until it stings,
 We curse it then and sigh for wings.
 We live, we love, we woo, we wed,
 We wreathe our prides, we sheet our dead.
 We laugh, we weep, we hope, we fear,
 And that's the burden of a year.

	-- Ella Wheeler Wilcox

Ms. Wilcox was introduced in Minstrels, Poem #911 ("The Traveled Man");
this poem I think speaks for itself. 

Thank you, and happy holidays,

[And a very Happy New Year to all our faithful Minstrels subscribers!

 "The Boy Who Laughed at Santa Claus"

 In Baltimore there lived a boy.
 He wasn't anybody's joy.
 Although his name was Jabez Dawes,
 His character was full of flaws. 

	In school he never led his classes,
 He hid old ladies' reading glasses,
 His mouth was open when he chewed,
 And elbows to the table glued.
 He stole the milk of hungry kittens,
 And walked through doors marked NO ADMITTANCE.
 He said he acted thus because
 There wasn't any Santa Claus.

	Another trick that tickled Jabez
 Was crying 'Boo' at little babies.
 He brushed his teeth, they said in town,
 Sideways instead of up and down.
 Yet people pardoned every sin,
 And viewed his antics with a grin,
 Till they were told by Jabez Dawes,
 'There isn't any Santa Claus!'

	Deploring how he did behave,
 His parents swiftly sought their grave.
 They hurried through the portals pearly,
 And Jabez left the funeral early.

 	Like whooping cough, from child to child,
 He sped to spread the rumor wild:
 'Sure as my name is Jabez Dawes
 There isn't any Santa Claus!'
 Slunk like a weasel of a marten
 Through nursery and kindergarten,
 Whispering low to every tot,
 'There isn't any, no there's not!'

	The children wept all Christmas eve
 And Jabez chortled up his sleeve.
 No infant dared hang up his stocking
 For fear of Jabez' ribald mocking. 

		He sprawled on his untidy bed,
 Fresh malice dancing in his head,
 When presently with scalp-a-tingling,
 Jabez heard a distant jingling;
 He heard the crunch of sleigh and hoof
 Crisply alighting on the roof.
 What good to rise and bar the door?
 A shower of soot was on the floor.

	What was beheld by Jabez Dawes?
 The fireplace full of Santa Claus!
 Then Jabez fell upon his knees
 With cries of 'Don't,' and 'Pretty Please.'
 He howled, 'I don't know where you read it,
 But anyhow, I never said it!'
 'Jabez' replied the angry saint,
 'It isn't I, it's you that ain't.
 Although there is a Santa Claus,
 There isn't any Jabez Dawes!'

	Said Jabez then with impudent vim,
 'Oh, yes there is, and I am him!
 Your magic don't scare me, it doesn't'
 And suddenly he found he wasn't!
 From grimy feet to grimy locks,
 Jabez became a Jack-in-the-box,
 And ugly toy with springs unsprung,
 Forever sticking out his tongue.

	The neighbors heard his mournful squeal;
 They searched for him, but not with zeal.
 No trace was found of Jabez Dawes,
 Which led to thunderous applause,
 And people drank a loving cup
 And went and hung their stockings up.

	All you who sneer at Santa Claus,
 Beware the fate of Jabez Dawes,
 The saucy boy who mocked the saint.
 Donner and Blitzen licked off his paint. 

	-- Ogden Nash 

It's a bit too  early for Christmas [not any more it isn't! -- ed.], but
I had to send this one in -- it is one of Nash's real gems. I'll not say
much about it -- a light, witty ditty, showing Ogden Nash's typical
flair for nonsense verse.  I'll let your readers chuckle over its silly
simplicity, without my analyzing or philosophizing over it.

 "Hello In There"

 We had an apartment in the city,
 Me and Loretta liked living there.
 Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown, 
 A life of their own left us alone.
 John and Linda live in Omaha,
 And Joe is somewhere on the road.
 We lost Davy in the Korean war,
 And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore.

 Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger, 
 And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day.
 Old people just grow lonesome
 Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello."

 Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more, 
 She sits and stares through the back door screen.
 And all the news just repeats itself
 Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen.
 Someday I'll go and call up Rudy,
 We worked together at the factory.
 But what could I say if asks "What's new?"
 "Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do."

 So if you're walking down the street sometime 
 And spot some hollow ancient eyes, 
 Please don't just pass 'em by and stare 
 As if you didn't care, say, "Hello in there, hello."

	-- John Prine

I am  a little surprised not to see John Prine on the Minstrels. Hailed
by some on his debut as "the next Dylan " he has had many of his folksy
lyrics sung by other famous singers. As the developed world including
America ages, with larger percentages of older people in their
populations, this poem captures some of the increasing loneliness they
feel. The stanza contrasting old people to old trees and old rivers is
particularly powerful.

BY EXAMPLE 
  By
  Henry Matthew Ward 
   
   
  When I got mad and hit my child 
  "For his own good," I reconciled 
  And then, I realized my plight 
  Today, I taught my child to fight. 
  When interrupted by the phone I said, 
  "Tell them I'm not at home." 
  And then I thought, and had to sigh 
  Today I taught my child to lie.
  I told the tax man what I made 
  Forgetting cash that I was paid 
  And then I blushed at this sad feat 
  Today, I taught my child to cheat. 
  I smugly copied a cassette, 
  To keep me free of one more debt. 
  But now the bells of shame must peal 
  Today, I taught my child to steal. 
  Today, I cursed another race. 
  Oh God, protect what I debase, 
  For now, I fear it is too late. 
  Today, I taught my child to hate. 
  By my example, children learn 
  That I must lead in life's sojourn 
  In such a way that they are led 
  By what is done, not what is said. 
  Today, I gave my child his due 
  By Praises for him instead of rue. 
  And now I have begun my guide: 
  Today, I gave my child his pride. 
  I now have reconciled and paid 
  To IRS on all I made. 
  And now I know that this dear youth 
  Today has learned from me of Truth.
  The alms I give are not for show 
  And yet, this child must surely know 
  That charity is worth the price; 
  Today, he saw my sacrifice. 
  I clasp within a warm embrace 
  My neighbor of another race- 
  The great commandment from above. 
  Today, I taught my child to love.
