 "An Ethical Grook"

 I see
    and I hear
       and I speak no evil;
 I carry
    no malice
       within my breast;
 yet quite without
    wishing
       a man to the Devil
 one may be
    permitted
       to hope for the best.

	-- Piet Hein

This only sort of fits "the poet cranky" theme.  While I'm sure this was
written in jest, as so many of Hein's poems are, I feel it is a lovely turn
of phrase which most people can appreciate the sentiment behind.  I think
I've already exceeded the length of the poem with my comment so I'll stop
here.
