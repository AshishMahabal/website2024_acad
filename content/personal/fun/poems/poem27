"Learning"
   
 I'm learning to say thank you.
 And I'm learning to say please.
 And I'm learning to use Kleenex,
 Not my sweater, when I sneeze.
 And I'm learning not to dribble.
 And I'm learning not to slurp.
 And I'm learning (though it sometimes really hurts me)
 Not to burp.
 And I'm learning to chew softer
 When I eat corn on the cob.
 And I'm learning that it's much
 Much easier to be a slob. 
 
   -- Judith Viorst 

I memorized Viorst's "Learning" with my third grade son and recited it in
front of his third grade class, with him.  What a pleasure to share it,
parenting the same child who memorized it with me, as he was actually
learning little nuances of polite living.

It was a class assignment, and all the children memorized something and then
stood to recite, some with their parents, some going it alone.

Public school teachers are unsung heroes.  I thank mine whenever I get the
chance.

And a bunch of them have put together poetry sites for the little guys.
Here's a gateway site for several good children's poetry sites:
