"The Pub with No Beer"

 It's lonesome away from your kindred and all 
 By the camp fire at night where the wild dingoes call, 
 But there's nothing so lonesome so morbid or drear 
 Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer. 
 
 Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come 
 There's a far away look on the face of the bum 
 The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer 
 What a terrible place is a pub with no beer. 
 
 Then the stock-man rides up with his dry dusty throat 
 He breasts up to the bar, pulls a wad from his coat, 
 But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer, 
 When the bar man said sadly "The pub's got no beer".
 
 There's a dog on the 'randah for his master he waits 
 But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates 
 He hurries for cover and cringes in fear 
 It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer. 
 
 Old Billy the blacksmith first time in his life 
 Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife, 
 He walks in the kitchen, she says "You're early, me dear", 
 But then he breaks down and he tells her "The pub's got no beer".

Note: Based on Dan Sheahan's poem "A Pub Without Beer", and sung to the tune
of "Beautiful Dreamer" 

Following up on the outback poem, and not summer per se.  I wonder how many
people remember this song - from the 60s - !?

It was a top hit on the Binaca Hit Parade (Obviously it was also a #1 hit in
Australia and the UK!) - how many people remember this English countdown by
the late Hamid (Hameed?) Sayani - older brother of Ameen Sayani, who
compered the Hindi countdown Binaca Geet Mala on Radio Ceylon?

Hamid also anchored the Cadbury Amateur Hour, where budding singers could
exercise their vocal chords.

Hamid Sayani was killed in the Air India plane crash in Bombay in - was it
the New Year's day crash of 1978? Can't seem to find it on the web. This
great and lovable personality seems to have left almost no footprint on the
web.

Delhi AIR's own response to Radio Ceylon was "A Date with You" on Friday
evenings, and Hamid also compered this show. On Madras AIR, I can't remember
the name of the show, but the compere was Gayathri Krishnaswamy nee Grace
Adiappa.

India had other radio greats like Laurence "Bobby" Clark (?), Melville
D'Mello, Roshan Menon, Lotika Ratnam, .. to name just a few. And there is
almost nothing to be learned about them on the web.
