'Untitled'

 When the heart
 Is cut or cracked or broken
 Do not clutch it
 Let the wound lie open
 Let the wind
 From the good old sea blow in
 To bathe the wound with salt
 
 Let a stray dog lick it
 Let a bird lean in the hole and sing
 A simple song like a tiny bell
 And let it ring
 Let it go.  Let it out.
 Let it all unravel.
 Let it free and it can be
 A path on which to travel.
 
   -- Michael Leunig

This is a poem without a title, by the Australian writer, poet, cartoonist,
philosopher, Michael Leunig. I first discovered Leunig about 10 years ago
when a cousin gifted me one of his books, I have followed his work ever
since and have always found it endearing and enchanting. Like this poem
here, he talks of simple things around us, within us and talks of them in an
amazingly simple and human way; and reading his work mostly opens a tiny
window somewhere in the heart.

I hope everyone enjoys this!
