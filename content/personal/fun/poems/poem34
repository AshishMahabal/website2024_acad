 "Mahi-Mahi"

 Caught.
 Cooked onshore.
 Eaten.

 Better than a William Carlos Williams poem.

	-- Mairead Byrne

Mahi-mahi[1] ("strong-strong" in Hawai'ian) is a sweet tropical fish also
known as the dolphin fish or dorado. You can find some good recipes here[2].
Or, you can buy seasoned fillets of it at Trader Joe's. Delicious!

This poem is from Mairead Byrne's blog, Heaven[3]. It made me laugh because
it's a parody on WCW's shorter poems, like "The Red Wheelbarrow" or "This is
just to say." I guess it takes a poetry geek like me to think anything of
this poem, and I thought I would share it with the other poetry geeks out
there on the minstrels list!

Mairead Byrne is an Irish poet who now teaches at the Rhode Island School of
Design in Providence. More about her can be found at her home page at
Soundeye[4] or an interview with her at chicagopostmodernpoetry.com[5]. She
writes new poetry daily and she is almost constantly updating her blog,
which consists completely of poetry.
