	1. Newton's Method:

	   Let, the lion catch you.  For every action there is equal
	   and opposite reaction.  Implies you caught lion (Assuming
	   that you're alive).

	2. Einstein Method:

	   Run in the direction opposite to that of the lion.  Due to
	   higher relative velocity, the lion will also run faster and
	   will get tired soon.  Now you can trap it easily.

	3. Schrodinger Method:

           At any given moment, there is a positive probability that
           lion to be in the cage.  So set the trap, sit down and
           wait.

	4. Inverse Transformation Method:

           We place a spherical cage in the forest and enter it.
           Perform an inverse transformation with respect to lion.
           Lion is in and we are out.

	5. Thermodynamic Procedure:

           We construct a semi-permeable membrane which allows every
           thing to pass it except lions.  Then sweep the entire
           forest with it.

	6. Integration Differention Method:

           Integrate the forest over the entire the area.  The lion is
           some where in the result.  So differentiate the result
           PARTIALLY w.r.to lion to trace out the lion.

	7. The Banta's Method:

	   DON'T TRY. YOU'LL GET CAUGHT BY THE LION.
