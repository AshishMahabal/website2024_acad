abstract = "The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a sky survey covering 3750 sq. degrees down to 20.5 mag from the Palomar 1.2m telescope. It has been functional for close to two years, and with its field of view of ~47 square degrees the publicly released DR2 boasts of over 100 billion detections in g//r/i filters.  We will describe the data release and how it can be widely used for archival studies. We will emphasize the real-time and time-domain wonders from the survey with rapid follow-up of gravitational wave events as well as its plethora of discoveries including thousands of supernovae, several tidal disruption events, first atiras/vatiras and so on. We will finish by putting it in perspective with surveys to come including ZTF Phase II and LSST (now the Vera Rubin Observatory)."
